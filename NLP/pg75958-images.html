<p>“The Decay and the Restoration of Civilization”
is the first part of a complete philosophy of
civilization with which I have been occupied since
the year 1900.</p>

<p>The second part, entitled “Civilization and
Ethics”, will appear immediately. The third is
called “The World-View<a href="#in1" id="in1-ref" class="pginternal">*</a> of Reverence for Life”.
The fourth has to do with the civilized State.</p>

<p>That over which I have toiled since 1900 has been
finally ripened in the stillness of the primeval forest
of Equatorial Africa. There, during the years
1914-17, the clear and definite lines of this philosophy
of civilization have been developed.</p>

<p>The first part, “The Decay and the Restoration
of Civilization”, is a kind of introduction to the
philosophy of civilization. It states the problem of
civilization.</p>

<p>Entering on the question as to what is the real
essential nature of civilization, I come to the pronouncement
that this is ultimately ethical. I know
that in thus stating the problem as a moral one I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a class="tei" id="Pgviii"></a>
shall surprise and even disgust the spirit of our
times, which is accustomed to move amidst æsthetic,
historical and material considerations. I imagine,
however, that I am myself enough of an artist and
also of an historian to be able to comprehend the
æsthetic and historical elements in civilization, and
that, as a modern physician and surgeon, I am sufficiently
modern to appreciate the glamour of the
technical and material attainments of our age.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, I have come to the conviction
that the æsthetic and the historical elements,
and the magnificent extension of our material knowledge
and power, do not themselves form the essence
of civilization, but that this depends on the mental
disposition of the individuals and nations who exist
in the world. All other things are merely accompanying
circumstances of civilization, which have
nothing to do with its real essence.</p>

<p>Creative, artistic, intellectual, and material attainments
can only show their full and true effects when
the continued existence and development of civilization
have been secured by founding civilization
itself on a mental disposition which is truly ethical.
It is only in his struggle to become ethical that man
comes to possess real value as a personality; it is
only under the influence of ethical convictions that
the various relations of human society are formed
in such a way that individuals and peoples can
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a class="tei" id="Pgix"></a>
develop in an ideal manner. If the ethical foundation
is lacking, then civilization collapses, even
when in other directions creative and intellectual
forces of the strongest nature are at work.</p>

<p>This moral conception of civilization, which makes
me almost a stranger amidst the intellectual life of
my time, I express clearly and unhesitatingly, in
order to arouse amongst my contemporaries reflection
as to what civilization really is. We shall not
succeed in re-establishing our civilization on an
enduring basis until we rid ourselves completely of
the superficial concept of civilization which now
holds us in thrall, and give ourselves up again to
the ethical view which obtained in the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>The second point which I desire should obtain
currency is that of the connection between civilization
and our theory of the universe. At the present
time no regard is paid to this connection. In fact,
the period in which we are living altogether misses
the significance of having a theory of the universe.
It is the common conviction nowadays, of educated
and uneducated alike, that humanity will progress
quite satisfactorily without any theory of the
universe at all.</p>

<p>The real fact is that all human progress depends
on progress in its theory of the universe, whilst,
conversely, decadence is conditioned by a similar
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a class="tei" id="Pgx"></a>
decadence in this theory. Our loss of real civilization
is due to our lack of a theory of the universe.</p>

<p>Only as we again succeed in attaining a strong and
worthy theory of the universe, and find in it strong
and worthy convictions, shall we again become
capable of producing a new civilization. It is this
apparently abstract and paradoxical truth of which
I proclaim myself the champion.</p>

<p>Civilization, put quite simply, consists in our
giving ourselves, as human beings, to the effort to
attain the perfecting of the human race and the
actualization of progress of every sort in the circumstances
of humanity and of the objective world.
This mental attitude, however, involves a double
predisposition: firstly, we must be prepared to act
affirmatively toward the world and life; secondly,
we must become ethical.</p>

<p>Only when we are able to attribute a real meaning
to the world and to life shall we be able also to give
ourselves to such action as will produce results of
real value. As long as we look on our existence in
the world as meaningless, there is no point whatever
in desiring to effect anything in the world. We
become workers for that universal spiritual and
material progress which we call civilization only in
so far as we affirm that the world and life possess
some sort of meaning, or, which is the same thing,
only in so far as we think optimistically.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a class="tei" id="Pgxi"></a></p>

<p>Civilization originates when men become inspired
by a strong and clear determination to attain progress,
and consecrate themselves, as a result of this
determination, to the service of life and of the world.
It is only in ethics that we can find the driving force
for such action, transcending, as it does, the limits
of our own existence.</p>

<p>Nothing of real value in the world is ever accomplished
without enthusiasm and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>But it is impossible to convince men of the truth
of world- and life-affirmation and of the real value
of ethics by mere declamation. The affirmative and
ethical mentality which characterizes these beliefs
must originate in man himself as the result of an
inner spiritual relation to the world. Only then
will they accompany him as strong, clear, and constant
convictions, and condition his every thought
and action.</p>

<p>To put it in another way: world- and
life-affirmation must be the products of thought about
the world and life. Only as the majority of individuals
attain to this result of thought and continue
under its influence will a true and enduring civilization
make progress in the world. Should the mental
disposition towards world- and life-affirmation and
towards ethics begin to wane, or become dim and
obscured, we shall be incapable of working for true
civilization, nay, more, we shall be unable even to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a class="tei" id="Pgxii"></a>
form a correct concept of what such civilization
ought to be.</p>

<p>And this is the fate which has befallen us. We
are bereft of any theory of the universe. Therefore,
instead of being inspired by a profound and powerful
spirit of affirmation of the world and of life, we
allow ourselves, both as individuals and as nations,
to be driven hither and thither by a type of such
affirmation which is both confused and superficial.
Instead of adopting a determined ethical attitude,
we exist in an atmosphere of mere ethical phrases
or declare ourselves ethical sceptics.</p>

<p>How is it that we have got into this state of lacking
a theory of the universe? It is because hitherto
the world- and life-affirming and ethical theory of
the universe had no convincing and permanent
foundation in thought. We thought again and again
that we had found such a basis for it; but it lost
power again and again without our being aware that
it was doing so, until, finally, we have been obliged,
for more than a generation past, to resign ourselves
more and more to a complete lack of any world-theory
at all.</p>

<p>Thus, in this introductory part of my work, I
proclaim two truths and conclude with a great note
of interrogation. The truths are the following:
The basic ethical character of civilization, and the
connection between civilization and our theories of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg xiii]</span><a class="tei" id="Pgxiii"></a>
the universe. The question with which I conclude
is this: Is it at all possible to find a real and permanent
foundation in thought for a theory of the
universe which shall be both ethical and affirmative
of the world and of life?</p>

<p>The future of civilization depends on our overcoming
the meaninglessness and hopelessness which
characterize the thoughts and convictions of men
to-day, and reaching a state of fresh hope and fresh
determination. We shall be capable of this, however,
only when the majority of individuals discover
for themselves both an ethic and a profound
and steadfast attitude of world- and life-affirmation,
in a theory of the universe at once convincing and
based on reflection.</p>

<p>Without such a general spiritual experience there
is no possibility of holding our world back from the
ruin and disintegration towards which it is being
hastened. It is our duty then to rouse ourselves to
fresh reflection about the world and life.</p>

<p>In “Civilization and Ethics”, the second part of
this philosophy of civilization, I describe the road
along which thought has led me to world- and
life-affirmation and to ethics. The root-idea of my
theory of the universe is that my relation to my
own being and to the objective world is determined
by reverence for life. This reverence for life is given
as an element of my will-to-live, and becomes clearly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg xiv]</span><a class="tei" id="Pgxiv"></a>
conscious of itself as I reflect about my life and about
the world. In the mental attitude of reverence for
life which should characterize my contact with all
forms of life, both ethics and world- and life-affirmation
are involved. It is not any kind of insight into
the essential nature of the world which determines
my relation to my own existence and to the existence
which I encounter in the world, but rather
only and solely my own will-to-live which has
developed the power of reflection about itself and
the world.</p>

<p>The theory of the universe characterized by
reverence for life is a type of mysticism arrived at
by self-consistent thought when persisted in to its
ultimate conclusion. Surrendering himself to the
guidance of this mysticism, man finds a meaning
for his life in that he strives to accomplish his own
spiritual and ethical self-fulfilment, and, simultaneously
and in the same act, helps forward all the
processes of spiritual and material progress which
have to be actualized in the world.</p>

<p>I do not know how many, or how few, will allow
themselves to be persuaded to travel with me on
the road indicated above. What I desire above all
things—and this is the crux of the whole affair—is
that we should all recognize fully that our present
entire lack of any theory of the universe is the ultimate
source of all the catastrophes and misery of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexv">[pg xv]</span><a class="tei" id="Pgxv"></a>
our times, and that we should toil in concert for a
theory of the universe and of life, in order that thus
we may arrive at a mental disposition which shall
make us really and truly civilized men.</p>

<p>It was a great joy to me to be afforded the opportunity
of putting forward, in the <i>Dale Lectures</i>,
delivered in Oxford, the views on which this philosophy
of civilization is based.</p>

<p>I would tender my deepest thanks to my friends,
Mr. C. T. Campion, M.A., now of Grahamstown,
South Africa, and Dr. J. P. Naish, of Oxford. Mr.
Campion is the translator of this first part of the
“Philosophy of Civilization”. Dr. Naish has seen
the book through the press and translated this
preface.</p>

<h4>HOW PHILOSOPHY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
COLLAPSE OF CIVILIZATION</h4>

<p class="summary">Our self-deception as to the real conditions of our civilization. The
collapse of the theory of the universe on which our ideals were based.
The superficial character of modern philosophizing.</p>

<p class="drop">We are living to-day under the sign of the
collapse of civilization. The situation has not been
produced by the war; the latter is only a manifestation
of it. The spiritual atmosphere has
solidified into actual facts, which again react
on it with disastrous results in every respect.
This interaction of material and spiritual has
assumed a most unhealthy character. Just below
a mighty cataract we are driving along in a
current full of formidable eddies, and it will need the
most gigantic efforts to rescue the vessel of our fate
from the dangerous side channel into which we have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg001"></a>
allowed it to drift, and bring it back into the main
stream, if, indeed, we can hope to do so at all.</p>

<p>We have drifted out of the stream of civilization
because there was amongst us no real reflection upon
what civilization is. It is true that at the end of the
last century and the beginning of this there appeared
a number of works on civilization with the most
varied titles; but, as though in obedience to some
secret order, they made no attempt to settle and
make clear the conditions of our intellectual life, but
devoted themselves exclusively to its origin and
history. They gave us a relief map of civilization
marked with roads which men had observed or
invented, and which led us over hill and dale
through the fields of history from the Renaissance
to the twentieth century. It was a triumph for the
historical sense of the authors. The crowds whom
these works instructed were filled with satisfied
contentment when they understood that their
civilization was the organic product of so many
centuries of the working of spiritual and social forces,
but no one worked out and described the content of
our spiritual life. No one tested its value from the
point of view of the nobility of its ideas, and its
ability to produce real progress.</p>

<p>Thus we crossed the threshold of the twentieth
century with an unshakable conceit of ourselves,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg003"></a>
and whatever was written at that time about our
civilization only confirmed us in our ingenuous belief
in its high value. Anyone who expressed doubt was
regarded with astonishment. Many, indeed, who
were on the road to error, stopped and returned to
the main road again because they were afraid of the
path which led off to the side. Others continued
along the main road, but in silence; the understanding
and insight which were at work in them
only condemned them to isolation.</p>

<p>It is clear now to everyone that the suicide of
civilization is in progress. What yet remains of it
is no longer safe. It is still standing, indeed,
because it was not exposed to the destructive pressure
which overwhelmed the rest, but, like the rest,
is built upon rubble, and the next landslide will
very likely carry it away.</p>

<p>But what was it that preceded and led
up to this loss of power in the innate forces of
civilization?</p>

<p>The age of the Illuminati and of rationalism had
put forward ethical ideals, based on reason, concerning
the development of the individual to true
manhood, his position in society, the material and
spiritual problems which arose out of society, the
relations of the different nations to each other, and
their issue in a humanity which should be united in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg004"></a>
the pursuit of the highest moral and spiritual
objects. These ideals had begun, both in philosophy
and in general thought, to get into contact with
reality and to alter the general environment. In
the course of three or four generations there had
been such progress made, both in the ideas underlying
civilization and in their material embodiment,
that the age of true civilization seemed to have
dawned upon the world and to be assured of an
uninterrupted development.</p>

<p>But about the middle of the nineteenth century
this mutual understanding and co-operation between
ethical ideals and reality began to break down, and
in the course of the next few decades it disappeared
more and more completely. Without resistance,
without complaint, civilization abdicated. Its ideas
lagged behind, as though they were too exhausted
to keep pace with it. How did this come about?</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg">
</div>

<p>The decisive element in the production of this
result was philosophy’s renunciation of her duty.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century and the early part of the
nineteenth it was philosophy which led and guided
thought in general. She had busied herself with
the questions which presented themselves to mankind
at each successive period, and had kept the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg005"></a>
thought of civilized man actively reflecting upon
them. Philosophy at that time included within
herself an elementary philosophizing about man,
society, race, humanity and civilization, which produced
in a perfectly natural way a living popular
philosophy that controlled the general thought, and
maintained the enthusiasm for civilization.</p>

<p>But that ethical, and at the same time optimistic,
view of things in which the Illuminati and
rationalism had laid the foundations of this healthy
popular philosophy, was unable in the long run to
meet the criticism levelled at it by pure thought.
Its naïve dogmatism raised more and more prejudice
against it. Kant tried to provide the tottering
building with new foundations, undertaking to alter
the rationalistic view of things in accordance with
the demands of a deeper theory of knowledge, without,
however, making any change in its essential
spiritual elements. Goethe, Schiller and other
intellectual giants of the age, showed, by means of
criticism both kindly and malicious, that rationalism
was rather popular philosophy than real philosophy,
but they were not in a position to put into the place
of what they destroyed anything new which could
give the same effective support to the ideas about
civilization which were current in the general
thought of the time.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg006"></a></p>

<p>Fichte, Hegel, and other philosophers, who, for all
their criticism of rationalism, paid homage to its
ethical ideals, attempted to establish a similar
ethical and optimistic view of things by speculative
methods, that is by logical and metaphysical discussion
of pure being and its development into a
universe. For three or four decades they succeeded
in deceiving themselves and others with this
supposedly creative and inspiring illusion, and in
doing violence to reality in the interests of their
theory of the universe. But at last the natural
sciences, which all this time had been growing
stronger and stronger, rose up against them, and,
with a plebeian enthusiasm for the truth of reality,
reduced to ruins the magnificent creations of their
imagination.</p>

<p>Since that time the ethical ideas on which civilization
rests have been wandering about the world,
poverty-stricken and homeless. No theory of the
universe has been advanced which can give them a
solid foundation; in fact, not one has made its
appearance which can claim for itself solidity and
inner consistency. The age of philosophic dogmatism
had come definitely to an end, and after that
nothing was recognized as truth except the science
which described reality. General theories of the
universe no longer appeared as fixed stars; they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg007"></a>
were regarded as resting on hypothesis, and ranked
no higher than comets.</p>

<p>The same weapon which struck down the dogmatism
of knowledge about the universe struck down
also the dogmatic enunciation of spiritual ideas.
The early simple rationalism, the critical rationalism
of Kant, and the speculative rationalism of the great
philosophers of the nineteenth century had all alike
done violence to reality in two ways. They had
given a position above that of the facts of science to
the views which they had arrived at by pure thought,
and they had also preached a series of ethical ideals
which were meant to replace by new ones the various
existing relations in the ideas and the material
environment of mankind. When the first of these
two forms of violence was proved to be a mistaken
one, it became questionable whether the second
could still be allowed the justification which it had
hitherto enjoyed. The doctrinaire methods of
thought which made the existing world nothing but
material for the production of a purely theoretical
sketch of a better future were replaced by sympathetic
attempts to understand the historical origin
of existing things for which Hegel’s philosophy had
prepared the way.</p>

<p>With a general mentality of this description, a real
combination of ethical ideals with reality was no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg008"></a>
longer possible; there was not the freedom from
prejudice which that required, and so there came a
weakening of the convictions which were the driving
power of civilization. So, too, an end was put to
that justifiable violence to human convictions and
circumstances without which the reforming work of
civilization can make no advance, because it was
bound up with that other unjustifiable violence to
reality. That is the tragic element in the psychological
development of our spiritual life during the
latter half of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Rationalism, then, had been dismissed; but with
it went also the optimistic convictions as to the
moral meaning of the universe and of humanity, of
society and of man, to which it had given birth,
though the conviction still exerted so much influence
that no attention was paid to the catastrophe which
had really begun.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_1">
</div>

<p>Philosophy did not realize that the power of the
ideas about civilization which had been entrusted
to it was becoming a doubtful quantity. At the end
of one of the most brilliant works on the history of
philosophy which appeared at the close of the nineteenth
century philosophy is defined as the process
“by which there comes to completion, step by step,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg009"></a>
and with ever clearer and surer consciousness, that
conviction about the value of civilization the
universal validity of which it is the object of
philosophy itself to affirm.” But the author has
forgotten the essential point, viz., that there was a
time when philosophy did not merely convince itself
of the value of civilization, but also let its convictions
go forth as fruitful ideas destined to influence the
general thought, while from the middle of the nineteenth
century onwards these convictions had
become more and more of the nature of hoarded and
unproductive capital.</p>

<p>Once philosophy had been an active worker
producing universal convictions about civilization.
Now, after the collapse in the middle of the nineteenth
century, this same philosophy had become a
mere drawer of dividends, concentrating her activities
far from the world on what she had managed to
save. She had become a mere science, which sifted
the results of the historical and natural sciences, and
collected from them material for a future theory of
the universe, carrying on with this object in view a
learned activity in all branches of knowledge. At
the same time she became more and more absorbed
in the study of her own past. Philosophy came to
mean practically the history of philosophy, but the
creative spirit had left her. She became more and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg010"></a>
more a philosophy which contained no real thought.
She reflected, indeed, on the results achieved by the
individual sciences, but she lost the power of
thought about fundamental problems.</p>

<p>She looked back with condescending pity on the
rationalism which she had outstripped. She prided
herself on being able to trace her descent through
Kant, on having been shown by Hegel the inner
meaning of history, and on being at work to-day in
close sympathy with the natural sciences. But for
all that she was poorer than the poorest rationalism,
because she now carried on in imagination only, and
not in reality, the recognized work of philosophy,
which the latter had practised so zealously.
Rationalism, for all its simplicity, had been a
working philosophy, but philosophy herself had
now become, for all her insight, merely a pedantic
philosophy of degenerates. She still played, indeed,
some sort of <i>rôle</i> in schools and universities, but she
had no longer any message for the great world.</p>

<p>In spite of all her learning, she had become a
stranger to the world, and the problems of life which
occupied men and the whole thought of the age had
no part in her activities. Her way lay apart from
the general spiritual life, and just as she derived no
stimulus from the latter, so she gave none back.
Refusing to concern herself with fundamental
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg011"></a>
problems, she contained no fundamental philosophy
which could become a philosophy of the
people.</p>

<p>From this impotence came the aversion to all
generally intelligible philosophizing which is so
characteristic of her. Popular philosophy was for
her merely a review, prepared for the use of the
crowd, simplified, and therefore rendered inferior,
of the results given by the individual sciences which
she had herself sifted and put together in view of a
future theory of the universe. She was wholly
unconscious of several things, viz., that there is a
popular philosophy which arises out of such a
review; that it is just the province of philosophy to
deal with the primary, deeper questions about which
individuals and the crowd are thinking, or ought to
be thinking, to apply to them more comprehensive
and more thorough methods of thought, and then
restore them to general currency; and, finally, that
the value of any philosophy is in the last resort to be
measured by its capacity, or incapacity, to transform
itself into a living philosophy of the people.</p>

<p>Whatever is deep is also simple, and can be
reproduced as such, if only its relation to the whole
of reality is preserved. It is then something
abstract, which secures for itself a many-sided life
as soon as it comes into contact with facts.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg012"></a></p>

<p>Whatever of inquiring thought there was among
the general public was therefore compelled to
languish, because our philosophy refused either to
acknowledge or to help it. It found in front of it a
deep chasm which it could not cross.</p>

<p>Of gold coinage, minted in the past, philosophy
had abundance; hypotheses about a soon to be
developed theological theory of the universe filled
her vaults like unminted bullion; but food with
which to appease the spiritual hunger of the present
she did not possess. Deceived by her own riches,
she had neglected to plant any ground with nourishing
crops, and therefore, ignoring the hunger of the
age, she left the latter to its fate.</p>

<p>That pure thought never managed to construct
a theory of the universe of an optimistic, ethical
character, and to build up on that for a foundation
the ideals which go to produce civilization, was not
the fault of philosophy; it was a fact which became
evident as thought developed. But philosophy was
guilty of a wrong to our age in that it did not admit
the fact, but remained wrapped up in its illusion,
as though this were really a help to the progress of
civilization.</p>

<p>The ultimate vocation of philosophy is to be the
guide and guardian of the general reason, and it was
her duty, in the circumstances of the time, to confess
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg013"></a>
to our world that ethical ideals were no longer
supported by any general theory of the universe,
but were, till further notice, left to themselves, and
must make their way in the world by their own
innate power. She ought to have shown us that
we have to fight on behalf of the ideals on which our
civilization rests. She ought to have tried to give
these ideals an independent existence by virtue of
their own inner value and inner truth, and so to keep
them alive and active without any extraneous help
from a corresponding theory of the universe. No
effort should have been spared to direct the attention
of the cultured and the uncultured alike to the
problem of the ideals of civilization.</p>

<p>But philosophy philosophized about everything
except civilization. She went on working undeviatingly
at the establishment of a theoretical view of
the universe, as though by means of it everything
could be restored, and did not reflect that this theory,
even if it were completed, would be constructed only
out of history and science, and would accordingly
be unoptimistic and unethical, and would remain for
ever an “impotent theory of the universe,” which
could never call forth the energies needed for the
establishment and maintenance of the ideals of
civilization.</p>

<p>So little did philosophy philosophize about
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg014"></a>
civilization that she did not even notice that she
herself and the age along with her were losing more
and more of it. In the hour of peril the watchman
who ought to have kept us awake was
himself asleep, and the result was that we put up no
fight at all on behalf of our civilization.</p>

<h2 id="mbp_toc_2">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h4>HINDRANCES TO CIVILIZATION IN OUR ECONOMIC
AND SPIRITUAL LIFE</h4>

<p class="summary">The unfree economic position of the modern man. The undeveloped
condition of the modern man. The modern man’s want of humanity.
The lack of spiritual independence in the man of to-day.</p>

<p class="drop">Even if the abdication of thought has been, as we
have seen, the decisive factor in the collapse of our
civilization, there are yet a number of other causes
which combine with it to hinder our progress in this
regard. They are to be found in the field of
spiritual as well as in that of economic activity, and
depend, above all, on the interaction between the
two, an interaction which is unsatisfactory and
continually becoming more so.</p>

<p>The capacity of the modern man for progress
in civilization is diminished because the circumstances
in which he finds himself placed injure him
psychically and stunt his personality.</p>

<p>The development of civilization comes about—to
put it quite generally—by individual men thinking
out ideals which aim at the progress of the whole,
and then so fitting them to the realities of life that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg016"></a>
they assume the shape in which they can influence
most effectively the circumstances of the time. A
man’s ability to be a pioneer of progress, that is, to
understand what civilization is and to work for it,
depends, therefore, on his being a thinker and on his
being free. He must be the former if he is to be
capable of comprehending his ideals and putting
them into shape. He must be free in order to be in
a position to launch his ideals out into the general
life. The more completely his activities are taken
up in any way by the struggle for existence, the more
strongly will the impulse to improve his own condition
find expression in the ideals of his thought.
Ideals of self-interest then get mixed up with and
spoil his ideals of civilization.</p>

<p>Material and spiritual freedom are closely bound
up with one another. Civilization presupposes free
men, for only by free men can it be thought out and
brought to realization.</p>

<p>But among mankind to-day both freedom and the
capacity for thought have been sadly diminished.</p>

<p>If society had so developed that a continually
widening circle of the population could enjoy a
modest, but well-assured, condition of comfort,
civilization would have been much more helped
than it has been by all the material conquests which
are lauded in its name. These do, indeed, make
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg017"></a>
mankind as a whole less dependent upon nature,
but at the same time they diminish the number of
free and independent lives. The artisan who was
his own master becomes the factory hand through
the compulsion of machinery. Because in the
complicated business world of to-day only undertakings
with abundant capital behind them can
maintain their existence, the place of the small,
independent dealer is being taken more and more
completely by the employee. Even the classes
which still possess a larger or smaller amount of
property or maintain a more or less independent
activity get drawn more and more completely into
the struggle for existence because of the insecurity
of present conditions under the economic system of
to-day.</p>

<p>The lack of freedom which results is made worse
still because the factory system creates continually
growing agglomerations of people who are thereby
compulsorily separated from the soil which feeds
them, from their own homes and from nature.
Hence comes serious psychical injury. There is
only too much truth in the paradoxical saying that
abnormal life begins with the loss of one’s own
field and dwelling-place.</p>

<p>Civilization is, it is true, furthered to a certain
extent by the self-regarding ideals produced by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg018"></a>
groups of people who unite and co-operate in defence
of their similarly threatened interests in so far as
they seek to obtain an improvement in their material,
and thereby also in their spiritual, environment.
But these ideals are a danger to the idea of civilization
as such, because the form which they assume
is either not at all, or very imperfectly, determined
by the really universal interests of the community.
The consideration of civilization as such is held
back by the competition between the various
self-regarding ideals which go under its name.</p>

<p>To the want of freedom we have to add the evil
of overwork. For two or three generations numbers
of individuals have been living as workers merely,
not as human beings. Whatever can be said in a
general way about the moral and spiritual significance
of labour has no bearing on what they have
to do. An excessive amount of labour is the rule
to-day in every department of industry, with the
result that the labourer’s spiritual element cannot
possibly thrive. This overwork hits him indirectly
even in his childhood, for his parents, caught in the
inexorable toils of work, cannot devote themselves
to his up-bringing as they should. Thus his
development is robbed of something which can
never be made good, and later in life, when he himself
is the slave of over-long hours, he feels more and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg019"></a>
more the need of external distractions. To spend
the time left to him for leisure in self-cultivation, or
in serious intercourse with his fellows or with books,
requires a mental collectedness and a self-control
which he finds very difficult. Complete idleness,
forgetfulness, and diversion from his usual activities
are a physical necessity. He does not want to
think, and seeks not self-improvement, but entertainment,
that kind of entertainment, moreover,
which makes least demand upon his spiritual
faculties.</p>

<p>The mentality of this mass of individuals,
spiritually relaxed and incapable of self-collectedness,
reacts upon all those institutions which ought
to serve the cause of culture, and therewith of
civilization. The theatre takes a second place
behind the pleasure resort or the picture show, and
the instructive book behind the diverting one. An
ever increasing proportion of periodicals and newspapers
have to accommodate themselves to the
necessity of putting their matter before their
readers in the shape which lets it be assimilated
most easily. A comparison of the average newspapers
of to-day with those of fifty or sixty years
ago shows how thoroughly such publications have
had to change their methods in this respect.</p>

<p>When once the spirit of superficiality has penetrated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg020"></a>
into the institutions which ought to sustain
the spiritual life, these exercise on their part a
reflex influence on the society which they have
brought to this condition, and force on all alike this
state of mental vacuity.</p>

<p>How completely this want of thinking power has
become a second nature in men to-day is shown by
the kind of sociability which it produces. When
two of them meet for a conversation each is careful
to see that their talk does not go beyond generalities
or develop into a real exchange of ideas. No one
has anything of his own to give out, and everyone
is haunted by a sort of terror lest anything original
should be demanded from him.</p>

<p>The spirit produced in such a society of
never-concentrated minds is rising among us as an ever
growing force, and it results in a lowered conception
of what man should be. In ourselves, as in others
we look for nothing but vigour in productive work
and resign ourselves to the abandonment of any
higher ideal.</p>

<p>When we consider this want of freedom and of
mental concentration, we see that the conditions of
life for the inhabitants of our big cities are as
unfavourable as they could be. Naturally, then,
those inhabitants are in most danger on their
spiritual side. It is doubtful whether big cities
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg021"></a>
have ever been foci of civilization in the sense that
in them there has arisen the ideal of a man well and
truly developed as a spiritual personality; to-day,
at any rate, the condition of things is such that true
civilization needs to be rescued from the spirit that
issues from them and their inhabitants.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_2">
</div>


<p>But, besides the hindrance caused to civilization
by the modern man’s lack of freedom and of the
power of mental concentration, there is a further
hindrance caused by his imperfect development.
The enormous increase of human knowledge and
power, in specialized thoroughness as well as in extent,
necessarily leads to individual activities being
limited more and more to well-defined departments.
Human labour is organized and co-ordinated so
that specialization may enable individuals to make
the highest and most effective possible contribution.
The results obtained are amazing, but the spiritual
significance of the work for the worker suffers.
There is no call upon the whole man, only upon some
of his faculties, and this has a reflex effect upon his
nature as a whole. The faculties which build up
personality and are called out by comprehensive
and varied tasks are ousted by the less comprehensive
ones, which from this point of view are, in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg022"></a>
general sense of the word, less spiritual. The artisan
of to-day does not understand his trade as a whole
in the way in which his predecessor did. He no
longer learns, like the latter, to work the wood or the
metal through all the stages of manufacture; many
of these stages have already been carried out by
men and machines before the material comes into
his hands. Consequently his reflectiveness, his
imagination, and his skill are no longer called out
by ever varying difficulties in the work, and his
creative and artistic powers are atrophied. In
place of the normal self-consciousness which is
promoted by work into the doing of which he must
put his whole power of thought and his whole
personality, there comes a self-satisfaction which is
content with a fragmentary ability which, it may be
admitted, is perfect, and this self-satisfaction is
persuaded by its perfection in mastering details to
overlook its imperfection in dealing with the whole.</p>

<p>In all professions, most clearly perhaps in the
pursuit of science, we can recognize the spiritual
danger with which specialization threatens not only
individuals, but the spiritual life of the community.
It is already noticeable, too, that education is
carried on now by teachers who have not a wide
enough outlook to make their scholars understand
the interconnection of the individual sciences, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg023"></a>
to be able to give them a mental horizon as wide as
it should be.</p>

<p>Then, as if specialization and the organization of
work, where it is unavoidable, were not already
injurious enough to the soul of the modern man, it
is pursued and built up where it could be dispensed
with. In administration, in education, and in every
kind of calling the natural sphere of activity is
narrowed as far as possible by rules and superintendence.
How much less free in many countries
is the elementary school teacher of to-day compared
with what he was once! How lifeless and impersonal
has his teaching become as a result of all these
limitations!</p>

<p>Thus through our methods of work we have
suffered loss spiritually and as individuals just in
proportion as the material output of our collective
activity has increased. Here, too, is an illustration
of that tragic law which says that every gain brings
with it, somehow or other, a corresponding loss.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_3">
</div>

<p>But man to-day is in danger not only through
his lack of freedom, of the power of mental concentration,
and of the opportunity for all-round
development: he is in danger of losing his humanity.</p>

<p>The normal attitude of man to man is made very
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg024"></a>
difficult for us. Owing to the hurry in which we
live, to the increased facilities for intercourse, and
to the necessity for living and working with many
others in an overcrowded locality, we meet each
other continually, and in the most varied relations,
as strangers. Our circumstances do not allow us to
deal with each other as man to man, for the limitations
placed upon the activities of the natural man
are so general and so unbroken that we get accustomed
to them, and no longer feel our mechanical,
impersonal intercourse to be something that is
unnatural. We no longer feel uncomfortable that
in such a number of situations we can no longer be
men among men, and at last we give up trying to be
so, even when it would be possible and proper.</p>

<p>In this respect, too, the soul of the townsman is
influenced most unfavourably by his circumstances,
and that influence, in its turn, works most
unfavourably on the mentality of society.</p>

<p>Thus we tend to forget our relationship with our
fellows, and are on the path towards inhumanity.
Wherever there is lost the consciousness that every
man is an object of concern for us just because he is
man, civilization and morals are shaken, and the
advance to fully developed inhumanity is only a
question of time.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the most utterly inhuman
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg025"></a>
thoughts have been current among us for two
generations past in all the ugly clearness of language
and with the authority of logical principles. There
has been created a social mentality which discourages
humanity in individuals. The courtesy
produced by natural feeling disappears, and in its
place comes a behaviour which shows entire
indifference, even though it is decked out more or
less thoroughly in a code of manners. The standoffishness
and want of sympathy which are shown so
clearly in every way to strangers are no longer felt as
being really rudeness, but pass for the behaviour
of the man of the world. Our society has also ceased
to allow to all men, as such, a human value and a
human dignity; many sections of the human race
have become merely raw material and property in
human form. We have talked for decades with
ever increasing light-mindedness about war and
conquest, as if these were merely operations on a
chess-board; how was this possible save as the result
of a tone of mind which no longer pictured to itself
the fate of individuals, but thought of them only as
figures or objects belonging to the material world?
When the war broke out the inhumanity within us
had a free course. And what an amount of insulting
stuff, some decently veiled, some openly coarse,
about the coloured races, has made its appearance
during the last decades, and passed for truth and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg026"></a>
reason, in our colonial literature and our parliaments,
and so become an element in general public
opinion! Twenty years ago there was a discussion
in one of our Continental parliaments about some
deported negroes who had been allowed to die of
hunger and thirst; and there was no protest or
comment when, in a statement from the tribune, it
was said that they “had been lost” (“<i>eingegangen</i>”
or “<i>crêvé</i>”), as though it were a question of cattle!</p>

<p>In the education and the school books of to-day
the duty of humanity is relegated to an obscure
corner, as though it were no longer true that it is the
first thing necessary in the training of personality,
and as if it were not a matter of great importance
to maintain it as a strong influence in our human
race against the influence of outer circumstances.
It has not been so always. There was a time when
it was a ruling influence not only in schools, but in
literature, even down to the book of adventures.
Defoe’s hero, Robinson Crusoe, is continually
reflecting on the subject of humane conduct, and he
feels himself so responsible for loyalty to this duty
that when defending himself he is continually
thinking how he can sacrifice the smallest number
of human lives; he is so faithful, indeed, to this duty
of humanity, that the story of his adventures
acquires thereby quite a peculiar character. Is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg027"></a>
there among works of this kind to-day a single one
in which we shall find anything like it?</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_4">
</div>


<p>Another hindrance to civilization to-day is the
over-organization of our public life.</p>

<p>While it is certain that a properly ordered
environment is the condition and, at the same time,
the result of civilization, it is also undeniable that,
after a certain point has been reached, external
organization is developed at the expense of spiritual
life. Personality and ideas are then subordinated
to institutions, when it is really these which ought to
influence the latter and keep them inwardly alive.</p>

<p>If a comprehensive organization is established in
any department of social life, the results are at first
magnificent, but after a time they fall off. It is the
already existing resources which are realized at the
start, but later on the destructive influence of such
organization on what is living and original is clearly
seen in its natural results, and the more consistently
the organization is enlarged, the more strongly its
effect is felt in the repression of creative and spiritual
activity. There are modern States which cannot
recover either economically or spiritually from the
paralysing effects of a concentration which dates
from a very early period of their history.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg028"></a></p>

<p>The conversion of a wood into a park and its
maintenance as such may be a step towards carrying
out several different objects, but it is all over then
with the rich vegetation which would assure its
future condition in nature’s own way.</p>

<p>Political, religious and economic associations aim
to-day at forming themselves in such a way as will
combine the greatest possible inner cohesion with
the highest possible degree of external activity.
Constitution, discipline, and everything that belongs
to administration are brought to a perfection
hitherto unknown. They attain their object, but
just in proportion as they do so these centres of
activity cease to work as living organizations, and
come more and more to resemble perfected machines.
Their inner life loses in richness and variety because
the personalities of which they are composed must
needs decay in character.</p>

<p>Our whole spiritual life nowadays has its course
within organizations. From childhood up the man
of to-day has his mind so full of the thought of
discipline that he loses the sense of his own individuality
and can only see himself as thinking in the
spirit of some group or other of his fellows. A
thorough discussion between one idea and another
or between one man and another, such as constituted
the greatness of the eighteenth century, is never met
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg029"></a>
with now. But at that time fear of public opinion
was a thing unknown. All ideas had then to justify
themselves to the individual reason. To-day it is
the rule—and no one questions it—always to take
into account the views which prevail in organized
society. The individual starts by taking it for
granted that both for himself and his neighbours
there are certain views already established which they
cannot hope to alter, views which are determined
by nationality, creed, political party, social position,
and other elements in one’s surroundings. These
views are protected by a kind of taboo, and are not
only kept sacred from criticism, but are not a
legitimate subject of conversation. This kind of
intercourse, in which we mutually abjure our
natural quality as thinking beings, is euphemistically
described as respect for other people’s convictions,
as if there could be any convictions at all where
there is no thought.</p>

<p>The modern man is lost in the mass in a way
which is without precedent in history, and this is
perhaps the most characteristic trait in him. His
diminished concern about his own nature makes
him as it is susceptible, to an extent that is almost
pathological, to the views which society and its
organs of expression have put, ready made, into
circulation. Since, over and above this, society,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg030"></a>
with its well-constructed organization, has become
a power of as yet unknown strength in the spiritual
life, man’s want of independence in the face of it
has become so serious that he is almost ceasing to
claim a spiritual existence of his own. He is like
a rubber ball which has lost its elasticity, and preserves
indefinitely every impression that is made
upon it. He is under the thumb of the mass, and he
draws from it the opinions on which he lives,
whether the question at issue is national or political
or one of his own belief or unbelief.</p>

<p>Yet this abnormal subjection to external influences
does not strike him as being a weakness. He
looks upon it as an achievement, and in his unlimited
spiritual devotion to the interests of the community
he thinks he is preserving the greatness of the modern
man. He intentionally exaggerates our natural
social instincts into something fantastically great.</p>

<p>It is just because we thus renounce the indefeasible
rights of the individual that our race can
neither produce new ideas nor make current ones
serviceable for new objects; its only experience is
that prevailing ideas obtain more and more authority,
take on a more and more one-sided development,
and live on till they have produced their last
and most dangerous consequences.</p>

<p>Thus we have entered on a new mediæval period.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg031"></a>
The general determination of society has put freedom
of thought out of fashion, because the majority
renounce the privilege of thinking as free personalities,
and let themselves be guided in everything
by those who belong to the various groups and
cliques.</p>

<p>Spiritual freedom, then, we shall recover only
when the majority of individuals become once more
spiritually independent and self-reliant, and discover
their natural and proper relation to those
organizations in which their souls have been
entangled. But liberation from the Middle Ages
of to-day will be a much more difficult process than
that which freed the peoples of Europe from the
first Middle Ages. The struggle then was against
external authority established in the course of
history. To-day the task is to get the mass of
individuals to work themselves out of the condition
of spiritual weakness and dependence to which they
have brought themselves. Could there be a harder
task?</p>

<p>Moreover, no one as yet clearly perceives what a
condition of spiritual poverty is ours to-day. Every
year the spread of opinions which have no thought
behind them is carried further by the masses, and
the methods of this process have been so perfected,
and have met with such a ready welcome, that our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg032"></a>
confidence in being able to raise to the dignity of
public opinion the silliest of statements, wherever
it seems necessary to get them currently accepted,
has no need to justify itself before acting.</p>

<p>During the war the control of thought was made
complete. Propaganda definitely took the place of
truth.</p>

<p>With independence of thought thrown overboard,
we have, as was inevitable, lost our faith in truth.
Our spiritual life is disorganized, for the
over-organization of our external environment leads to
the organization of our absence of thought.</p>

<p>Not only in the intellectual sphere, but in the
moral also, the relation between the individual
and the community has been upset. With the
surrender of his own personal opinion the modern
man surrenders also his personal moral judgment.</p>

<p>In order that he may find good what the mass
declares to be such, whether in word or deed, and
may condemn what it declares to be bad, he suppresses
the scruples which stir in him. He does not
allow them to find utterance either with others or
with himself. There are no stumbling-blocks which
his feeling of unity with the herd does not enable
him to surmount, and thus he loses his judgment in
that of the mass, and his own morality in theirs.</p>

<p>Above all, he is thus made capable of excusing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg033"></a>
everything that is meaningless, cruel, unjust, or bad
in the behaviour of his nation. Unconsciously to
themselves, the majority of the members of our
barbarian civilised States give less and less time to
reflection as moral personalities, so that they may
not be continually coming into inner conflict with
their fellows as a body, and continually having to
get over things which they feel to be wrong.</p>

<p>Public opinion helps them by popularizing the
idea that the actions of the community are not to be
judged so much by the standards of morality as by
those of expediency, but they suffer injury to their
souls. If we find among men of to-day only too
few whose human and moral sensibility is still
undamaged, the chief reason is that the majority
have offered up their personal morality on the altar
of their country, instead of remaining at variance
with the mass and acting as a force which impels
the latter along the road to perfection.</p>

<p>Not only between the economic and the spiritual,
then, but also between the mass of men and
individuals, there has developed a condition of
unfavourable action and reaction. In the days of
rationalism and serious philosophy the individual
got help and support from society through the
general confidence in the victory of the rational and
moral, which society never failed to acknowledge
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg034"></a>
as something which explained and justified itself.
Individuals were then carried along by the mass;
we are stifled by it. The bankruptcy of the civilized
State, which becomes more manifest every
decade, is ruining the man of to-day. The demoralization
of the individual by the mass is in full swing.</p>

<p>The man of to-day pursues his dark journey in a
time of darkness, as one who has no freedom, no
mental collectedness, no all-round development, as
one who loses himself in an atmosphere of inhumanity,
who surrenders his spiritual independence
and his moral judgment to the organized society in
which he lives, and who finds himself in every direction
up against hindrances to the temper of true civilization.
Of the dangerous position in which he is placed
philosophy has no understanding, and therefore
makes no attempt to help him. She does not even
urge him to reflection on what is happening to himself.</p>

<p>The terrible truth that with the progress of
history and the economic development of the world
it is becoming not easier, but harder, to develop true
civilization, has never found utterance.</p>

<h2 id="mbp_toc_3">CHAPTER III</h2>
<h4>CIVILIZATION ESSENTIALLY ETHICAL IN CHARACTER</h4>

<p class="summary">What is civilization? Origin of the unethical conception of civilization.
Our sense of reality. Our historical sense. Nationalism. National
civilization. Our misleading trust in facts and organization. The true
sense for reality.</p>

<p class="drop">This question ought to have been pressing itself
on the attention of all men who consider themselves
civilized, but it is remarkable that in the world’s
literature generally one hardly finds that it has
been put at all until to-day, and still more rarely
is any answer given. It was supposed that there
was no need for a definition of civilization, since
we already possessed the thing itself. If the
question was ever touched upon, it was considered
to be sufficiently settled with references to history
and the present day. But now, when events are
bringing us inexorably to the consciousness that we
live in a dangerous medley of civilization and
barbarism, we must, whether we wish to or not,
try to determine the nature of true civilization.</p>

<p>For a quite general definition we may say that
civilization is progress, material and spiritual
progress, on the part of individuals as of the mass.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg036"></a></p>

<p>In what does it consist? First of all in a lessening
of the strain imposed on individuals and on the mass
by the struggle for existence. The establishment of
as favourable conditions of living as possible for all
is a demand which must be made partly for its own
sake, partly with a view to the spiritual and moral
perfecting of individuals, which is the ultimate
object of civilization.</p>

<p>The struggle for existence is a double one: man has
to assert himself in nature and against nature, and
similarly also among his fellow-men and against them.</p>

<p>A diminution of the struggle is secured by strengthening
the supremacy of reason over both external
nature and human nature, and making it subserve
as accurately as possible the ends proposed.</p>

<p>Civilization is then twofold in its nature: it realizes
itself in the supremacy of reason, first, over the forces
of nature, and, secondly, over the dispositions of men.</p>

<p>Which of these kinds of progress is most truly
progress in civilization? The latter, though it is the
least open to observation. Why? For two reasons.
First, the supremacy which we secure by reason over
external nature represents not unqualified progress,
but a progress which brings with its advantages also
disadvantages which may work in the direction of
barbarism. The reason why the economic circumstances
of our time endanger our civilization is to be
sought for partly in the fact that we have pressed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg037"></a>
into our service natural forces which can be
embodied in machines. But with that there must
be such a supremacy of reason over the dispositions
of men that they, and the nations which they form,
will not use against one another the power which the
control of these forces gives them, and thus plunge
one another into a struggle for existence which is
far more terrible than that between men in a state
of nature.</p>

<p>A normal claim to be civilized can, then, only be
reckoned as valid when it recognizes this distinction
between what is essential in civilization and what is
not.</p>

<p>Both kinds of progress can, indeed, be called
spiritual in the sense that they both rest upon a
spiritual activity in man, yet we may call the
supremacy over natural forces material progress
because in it material objects are mastered and
turned to man’s use. The supremacy of reason over
human dispositions, on the other hand, is a spiritual
achievement in another sense, in that it means the
working of spirit upon spirit, <i>i.e.</i>, of one section
of the power of reflexion upon another section of it.</p>

<p>And what is meant by the supremacy of the
reason over human dispositions? It means that
both individuals and the mass let their willing be
determined by the material and spiritual good of
the whole and the individuals that compose it; that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg038"></a>
is to say, their actions are ethical. Ethical progress
is, then, that which is truly of the essence of civilization,
and has only one significance; material
progress is that which is not of the essential at all,
and may have a twofold effect on the development of
civilization. This moral conception of civilization
will strike some people as rationalistic and old-fashioned.
It accords better with the spirit of our
times to conceive of civilization as a natural manifestation
of life in the course of human evolution, but
one with most interesting complications. We are
concerned, however, not with what is ingenious, but
with what is true. In this case the simple is the
true—the inconvenient truth with which it is our
laborious task to deal.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_5">
</div>


<p>The attempts to distinguish between civilization
as what the Germans call “Kultur” and civilization
as mere material progress aim at making the
world familiar with the idea of an unethical form
of civilization side by side with the ethical, and at
clothing the former with a word of historical
meaning. But nothing in the history of the word
“civilization” justifies such attempts. The word,
as commonly used hitherto, means the same as the
German “Kultur”, viz., the development of man
to a state of higher organization and a higher
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg039"></a>
moral standard. Some languages prefer one word;
others prefer the other. The German usually
speaks of “Kultur”, the Frenchman usually of
“civilisation”, but the establishment of a difference
between them is justified neither philologically nor
historically. We can speak of ethical and unethical
“Kultur” or of ethical and unethical “civilisation”,
but not of “Kultur” and “civilisation”.</p>

<p>But how did it come about that we lost the idea
that the ethical has a decisive meaning and value
as part of civilization?</p>

<p>All attempts at civilization hitherto have been a
matter of processes in which the forces of progress
were at work in almost every department of life.
Great achievements in art, architecture, administration,
economics, industry, commerce, and colonization
succeeded each other with a spiritual impetus
which produced a higher conception of the universe.
Any ebb of the tide of civilization made itself felt
in the material sphere as well as in the ethical and
spiritual, earlier, as a rule, in the former than in the
latter. Thus in Greek civilization there set in as
early as the time of Aristotle an incomprehensible
arrest of science and political achievement, whereas
the ethical movement only reached its completion
in the following centuries in that great work of
education which was undertaken in the ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg040"></a>
world by the Stoic philosophy. In the Chinese,
Indian and Jewish civilizations ability in dealing
with material things was from the start, and always
remained, at a lower level than the spiritual and
ethical efforts of these races.</p>

<p>In the movement of civilization which began with
the Renaissance, there were both material and
spiritual-ethical forces of progress at work side by
side, as though in rivalry with each other, and this
continued down to the beginning of the nineteenth
century. Then, however, something unprecedented
happened: man’s ethical energy died away, while
the conquests achieved by his spirit in the material
sphere increased by leaps and bounds. Thus for
several decades our civilization enjoyed the great
advantages of its material progress while as yet it
hardly felt the consequences of the dying down of
the ethical movement. People lived on in the
conditions produced. By that movement without
seeing clearly that their position was no longer a
tenable one and preparing to face the storm that
was brewing in the relations between the nations
and within the nations themselves. In this way
our own age, having never taken the trouble to
reflect, arrived at the opinion that civilization
consists primarily in scientific, technical and artistic
achievements, and that it can reach its goal without
ethics, or, at any rate, with a minimum of them.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg041"></a></p>

<p>Public opinion bowed down before this merely
external conception of civilization because it was
exclusively represented by persons whose position in
society and scientific culture seemed to show them to
be competent to judge in matters of the spiritual life.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_6">
</div>

<p>What was the result of our giving up the
ethical conception of civilization, and therewith
all attempts to bring reasoned ethical ideals into
effective relation with reality? It was that instead
of using thought to produce ideals which fitted
in with reality, we left reality without any ideals
at all. Instead of discussing together the essential
elements, such as population, State, Church,
society, progress, which decide the character of our
social development and that of mankind generally,
we contented ourselves with starting from what is
given by experience. Only forces and tendencies
which were already at work were to be considered.
Fundamental truths and convictions which ought
to produce logical or ethical compulsion we would
no longer acknowledge. We refused to believe that
any ideas could be applicable to reality except those
derived from experience. Thus ideals which had
been knowingly and intentionally lowered dominated
our spiritual life and the whole world.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg042"></a></p>

<p>How we glorified our practical common-sense,
which was to give us such power in dealing with the
world! Yet we were behaving, really, like boys who
give themselves up exultingly to the forces of nature
and whizz down a hill on their toboggan without
asking themselves whether they will be able to steer
their vehicle successfully when they come to the
next bend or the next unexpected obstacle.</p>

<p>It is only a conviction which is based upon
reasoned ethical ideals that is capable of producing
free activity, <i>i.e.</i>, activity deliberately planned with
a view to its object. In proportion as ideals taken
from the workaday world are combined with it,
reality influences reality. But then the human
soul acts merely as an agent of debasing change.</p>

<p>Events which are to produce practical results
within us are worked upon and moulded by our
mentality. This mentality has a certain character,
and on that character depends the nature of those
value-judgments which rule our relation to facts.</p>

<p>Normally this character is to be found in the
reasoned ideas which our reflection upon reality
brings into existence. If these disappear there is
not left a void in which “events in themselves” can
affect us, but the control of our mentality passes now
to the opinions and feelings which hitherto have
been ruled and kept under by our reasoned ideas.
When the virgin forest is cut down, brushwood
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg043"></a>
springs up where the big trees were formerly.
Whenever our great convictions are destroyed their
place is taken by smaller ones which carry out in
inferior fashion the functions of the former.</p>

<p>With the giving up of ethical ideals which accompanies
our passion for reality our practical efficiency
is not, therefore, improved, but diminished. It does
not make the man of to-day a cool observer and
calculator such as he supposes himself to be, for he is
under the influence of opinions and emotions which
are created in him by facts. All unconsciously he
mixes with what is the work of his reason so much of
what is emotional that the one spoils the other.
Within this circle move the judgments and impulses
of our society, whether we deal with the largest questions
or the smallest. Individuals and nations alike,
we deal indiscriminately with real and imaginary
values, and it is just this confused medley of real and
unreal, of sober thought and capacity for enthusiasm
for the unmeaning, that makes the mentality of the
modern man so puzzling and so dangerous.</p>

<p>Our sense of reality, then, means this, that, as a
result of emotional and short-sighted calculations
of advantage, we let one fact issue immediately in
another, and so on indefinitely. As we are not
consciously aiming at any definitely planned goal,
our activity may really be described as a kind of
natural happening.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg044"></a></p>

<p>We react to facts in the most irrational way.
Without plan or foundations we build our future
into the circumstances of the time and leave it
exposed to the destructive effects of the chaotic
jostling that goes on amongst them. “Firm ground
at last”! we cry, and sink helpless in the stream
of events.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_7">
</div>

<p>The blindness with which we endure this fate is
made worse by our belief in our historical sense,
which, in this connection, is nothing else than our
sense of reality prolonged backwards. We believe
ourselves to be a critical generation which, thanks
to its thorough knowledge of the past, is in a
position to understand the direction which events
are destined to take from the present to the future.
We add to the ideals which have been taken from
existing reality others which we borrow from history.</p>

<p>The achievements of historical science reached by
the nineteenth century do, indeed, deserve our
admiration, but it is another question whether our
generation, for all its possession of an historical
science, possesses a true historical sense.</p>

<p>Historical sense, in the full meaning of the term,
implies a critical objectivity in the face of far-off and
recent events alike. To keep this faculty free from
the bias of opinions and interests when we are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg045"></a>
estimating facts is a power which even our
historians do not possess. As long as they are
dealing with a period so remote that it has no bearing
on the present they are critical so far as the views
of the school to which they belong allow it. But
if the past stands in any real connection with
“to-day”, we can perceive at once in their estimate
the influence of their particular standpoint, rational,
religious, social or economic.</p>

<p>It is significant that while during the last few
decades the learning of our historians has, no doubt,
increased, their critical objectivity has not. Previous
investigators kept this ideal before their eyes in
much greater purity than have those of to-day; we
have gone so far that we no longer seriously make
the demand that in scientific dealings with the past
there shall be a suppression of all prejudices which
spring from nationality or creed. It is quite
common nowadays to see the greatest learning
bound up with the strongest bias. In our historical
literature the highest positions are occupied by
works written with propagandist aims.</p>

<p>So little educative influence has science had on
our historians that they have often espoused as
passionately as anyone the opinions of their own
people instead of calling the latter to a thoughtful
estimate of the facts, as was their duty to their
profession; they have remained nothing but men
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg046"></a>
of learning. They have not even started on the task
for which they entered the service of civilization, and
the hopes of civilization, which in the middle of the
nineteenth century rested on the rise of a science of
history, have been as little fulfilled as those which
were bound up with the demand for national States
and democratic forms of government.</p>

<p>The generation that has been brought up by
teachers such as these has naturally not much idea
of an elevated or active conception of events.
Accurately viewed, its characteristic feature is not
so much that we understand our past better than
earlier generations understood theirs, but rather that
we attribute to the past an extraordinarily increased
meaning for the present. Now and again we
actually substitute it for the latter. It is not enough
for us that what has been is present in its results in
what now is; we want to have it always with us,
and to feel ourselves determined by it.</p>

<p>In this effort to be continually experiencing our
historical process of becoming, and to acknowledge
it, we replace our normal relation to the past by an
artificial one, and wishing to find within the past the
whole of our present, we misuse it in order to deduce
from it, and to legitimize by an appeal to it, our
claims, our opinions, our feelings and our passions.
Under the very eyes of our historical learning there
springs up a manufactured history for popular use,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg047"></a>
in which the current national and confessional ideas
are unreservedly approved and upheld, and our
school history books become regular culture beds of
historical lies.</p>

<p>The misuse of history is a necessity for us. The
ideas and dispositions which rule us cannot be
justified by reason; nothing is left for us but to give
them foundations in history.</p>

<p>It is significant that we have no real interest in
what is valuable in the past. Its great spiritual
achievements are mechanically registered, but we do
not let ourselves be touched by them. Still less do
we accept them as a heritage; nothing has any
value for us except what can be squared with our
plans, passions, feelings, and æsthetic moods of
to-day. With these we live ourselves by lies into
the past, and then assert with unshaken assurance
that we have our roots in it.</p>

<p>This is the character of the reverence we pay to
history. Blinded by what we consider or declare
to be past and done with, we lose all sense for what
is to happen, so that of nothing can we say: “It is
finished,” nothing now gets accomplished. Again
and again we let what is past rise up artificially in
what is present, and endow bygone facts with a
persistence of being which makes wholly impossible
the normal development of our peoples. Just as
our sense of reality makes us lose ourselves in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg048"></a>
present-day events, so does our historical
compel us to do the same in those of the past.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_8">
</div>

<p>From these two things, our sense of reality and
our historical sense, is born the nationalism to
which we must refer the external catastrophe in
which the decadence of our civilization finds its
completion.</p>

<p>What is nationalism? It is an ignoble patriotism,
exaggerated till it has lost all meaning, which bears
the same relation to the noble and healthy kind as
the fixed idea of an imbecile does to normal
conviction.</p>

<p>How does it develop among us?</p>

<p>About the beginning of the nineteenth century
the course of thought gave the national State its
rightful position, starting for this from the axiom
that it, as a natural and homogeneous organism, was
better calculated than any other to make the ideal
of the civilized State a working reality. In Fichte’s
addresses to the German nation the nation-State is
summoned to the bar of the moral reason and learns
that it has to submit in all things to the latter. It
gives the necessary promise and straightway receives
a commission to bring the civilized State into
existence. It is given emphatically to understand
that it must recognize as its highest task the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg049"></a>
continuous and steady development of the purely
human element in the nation’s life. It is to seek
greatness by representing the ideas which can bring
healing to the nations. Its citizens are urged to
show their membership of it not through the lower,
but through the higher, patriotism, that is, not to
overvalue its external greatness and power, but to
be careful to take for their aim “the unfolding of
what is eternal and Godlike in the world,” and to see
that their objects coincide with the highest aims of
humanity. Thus national feeling is placed under
the guardianship of reason, morality and civilization.
The cult of patriotism as such is to be considered as
barbarism; it does, indeed, announce itself to be
such by the purposeless wars which it necessarily
brings in its train.</p>

<p>In this way the idea of nationality was raised to
the level of a valuable ideal of civilization. When
civilization began to decline, its other ideals all fell
also, but the idea of nationality maintained itself
because it had transferred itself to the sphere of
reality. It incorporated henceforward all that
remained of civilization, and became the ideal
which summed up all others. Here, then, we have
the explanation of the mentality of our age, which
concentrates all the enthusiasm of which it is capable
on the idea of nationality, and believes itself to
possess in that all moral and spiritual good things.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg050"></a></p>

<p>But with the decay of civilization the character
of the idea of nationality changed. The guardianship
exercised over it by the other moral ideals to
which it had hitherto been subordinate now ceased,
since these were themselves on trial, and the
nationalist idea began a career of independence.
It asserted, of course, that it was working in the
service of civilization, but it was, in truth, only an
idea of reality with a halo of civilization round it,
and it was guided by no ethical ideals, but only by
the instincts which deal with reality.</p>

<p>That reason and morality shall not be allowed to
contribute a word to the formation of nationalist
ideas and aspirations is demanded by the mass
of men to-day as a sparing of their holiest
feelings.</p>

<p>If in earlier times the decay of civilization did not
produce any such confusion in the sentiments of the
various nations, this was because the idea of
nationality had not then been raised in the same
way to be the ideal of civilization. It was, therefore,
impossible that it should insinuate itself into
the place of the true ideals of civilization, and
through abnormal nationalist conceptions and dispositions
bring into active existence an elaborate
system of uncivilization.</p>

<p>That in nationalism we have to do not so much
with things as with the unhealthy way in which they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg051"></a>
are dealt with in the imagination of the crowd, is
clear from its whole behaviour. It claims to be
following a policy of practical results (Realpolitik);
in reality it by no means represents the uncompromisingly
businesslike view of all the questions
of home and foreign policy, but side by side with
its egoism displays a certain amount of enthusiasm.
Its practical policy is an over-valuation of certain
questions of territorial economic interests, an
over-valuation which has been elevated to a dogma and
idealized, and is now supported by popular sentiment.
It fights for its demands without having
established any properly thought-out calculation of
their real value. In order to be able to dispute the
possession of millions of value, the modern State
loaded itself with armaments costing hundreds of
millions. Meaning to care for the protection and
extension of its trade, it loaded the latter with
imposts which imperilled its power of competing
with its rivals much more than did any of the
measures taken by those rivals.</p>

<p>Its practical politics were, therefore, in truth
impracticable politics, because they allowed popular
sentiment to come in, and thereby made the simplest
questions insoluble. This style of politics put
economic interests in the shop window, while it kept
in the warehouse the ideas about greatness and
conquest which belong to nationalism.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg052"></a></p>

<p>Every civilized State, in order to increase its
power, gathered allies wherever it could. Thus
half-civilized and uncivilized races were summoned
by civilized ones to fight against the civilized neighbours
of the latter, and these helpers were not
content with the subordinate <i>rôle</i> which had been
assigned to them. They acquired more and more
influence on the course of events, till they were at
last in a position to decide when the civilized nations
of Europe should begin to fight each other about
them. Thus has Nemesis come upon us for abandoning
our wishes and betraying to the uncivilized
world all that we still possessed of things that were
of universal value.</p>

<p>It was significant of the unhealthy character of
nationalism’s “practical” politics that it tried in
every possible way to deck itself out with a tinsel
imitation of idealism. The struggle for power
became one for right and civilization; the alliances
for the promotion of their selfish interests which
various nations made with one another against all
the rest were made to appear to be friendships and
spiritual affinities. As such they were dated back
into the past, even though history had a great deal
more to say about hereditary quarrels than about
spiritual relationships.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_9">
</div>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg053"></a></p>

<p>Finally, nationalism was not content with putting
aside, in the sphere of politics generally, all attempts
to bring into existence a really civilized humanity;
it distorted the very idea of civilization itself and
talked of national civilization.</p>

<p>Once there was what was known just simply as
civilization, and every civilized nation strove to
possess it in its purest and most fully developed
form. In this respect nationality had in the idea
of civilization at that time something much more
original and less spoilt than it has in the same idea
to-day. If, in spite of this, there was no impulse
among the nations to separate the spiritual life of
each from that of its neighbours, we have a proof
that nationality is not in itself the strong element
in the people that demanded this. Such a claim as
is made to-day to have a <i>national civilization</i> is an
unhealthy phenomenon. It presupposes that the
civilized peoples of to-day have lost their healthy
nature, and no longer follow instincts, but theories.
They percuss and sound their souls to such an
extent that these are no longer capable of any
natural action. They analyse and describe them
so continuously that in thinking of what they ought
to be they forget what they actually are. Questions
of spiritual differences between races are discussed
so subtly, and with such obstinacy and dogmatism,
that the talk works like an obsession, and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg054"></a>
peculiarities that are said to exist make their
appearance like imaginary diseases.</p>

<p>In every department of life more and more effort
is devoted to making clearly visible in the results
which follow from them the emotions, the ideas, and
the reasonings of the mass of the people. Any
peculiarity preserved and fostered in this way shows
that its natural counterpart has perished. The
individual element in the personality of a people
no longer, as something unconscious or half conscious,
plays with varying lights on the totality of the
nation’s spiritual life. It becomes an artifice, a
fashion, a self-advertisement, a mania. There is bred
in the nation a mass of thought, the serious results
of which in every department become more evident
year by year. The spiritual life of some of the
leading civilized nations has already, in comparison
with earlier days, taken on a monotonous tone such
as makes an observer feel anxious.</p>

<p>The unnatural character of this development
shows itself not only in its results, but in the part
which it allows to be played by conceit,
self-importance, and self-deception. Anything valuable
in a personality or a successful undertaking is
attributed to some special excellence in the national
character. Foreign soil is assumed to be incapable
of producing the same or anything similar, and in
most countries this vanity has grown to such a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg055"></a>
height that the greatest follies are no longer beyond
its reach.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that there follows a serious
decline in the spiritual element in the national
civilization. The spirituality is, moreover, only a
kind of disguise; it has in reality an avowedly
materialist character. It is a distillation from all
the external achievements of the nation in question
and appears in partnership with its economic and
political demands. While alleged to be grounded
in the national peculiarities, nationalist civilization
will not, as we should normally expect, remain
limited to the nation itself; it feels called upon to
impose itself upon others and make them happy!
Modern nations seek markets for their civilization,
as they do for their manufactures!</p>

<p>National civilization, therefore, is matter for
propaganda and for export, and the necessary
publicity is secured by liberal expenditure. The
necessary phrases can be obtained ready-made and
need only be strung together. Thus the world has
inflicted on it a competition between national
civilizations, and between these civilization itself
comes off badly.</p>

<p>The nations of Europe entered the Middle Ages
side by side as the heirs of the Greco-Roman world,
and lived side by side with the freest mutual intercourse
through the Renaissance, the period of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg056"></a>
Illuminati, and of the philosophy of more recent
times. But we no longer believe that they, with
their offshoots in the other continents, form an
indivisible unit of civilization. If, however, in this
latest age, the differences in their spiritual life have
begun to stand out more distinctly, the cause of it is
that the level of civilization has sunk. When the
tide ebbs, shallows which separate bodies of deep
water become visible; while the tide is flowing they
are out of sight.</p>

<p>How closely the nations which form the great
body of civilized humanity are still interrelated
spiritually is shown by the fact that they have all
side by side suffered the same decadence.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_10">
</div>

<p>With our sense of reality is bound up, further, the
false confidence which we have in facts. We live in
an atmosphere of optimism, as if the contradictions
which show themselves in the world arranged themselves
automatically so as to promote well-thought-out
progress, and reconciled themselves in syntheses
in which the valuable parts of the thesis and the
antithesis coalesced.</p>

<p>In justification of this optimism appeal is made,
both rightly and wrongly, to Hegel. It cannot be
denied that he is the spiritual father of our sense of
reality; he is the first thinker who tried to be just
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg057"></a>
to things as they exist. We have been trained by
him to realize the method of progress in thesis, antithesis,
and synthesis as they show themselves in the
course of events. But his optimism was not a
simple optimism about facts, as ours is. He lived
still in the spiritual world of rationalism, and believed
in the power of ethical ideas worked out by reason;
that was why he believed also in the certainty of
uninterrupted spiritual progress. And it was because
this was something upon which he could rely that
he undertook to show how it was to be seen in the
successive phases of events, and at the same time
how it made itself a reality in the stream of outward
facts. By emphasizing, however, the progressive
purpose, which he finds immanent in the course of
events, so strongly that it is possible to forget the
ethical-spiritual presuppositions of his belief in
progress, he is preparing the way for the despiritualized
optimism about reality which has for decades
been misleading us. Between the facts themselves
there is nothing but an endless series of contradictions.
The fresh mediating fact in which they
counteract each other so as to make progress
possible they cannot of themselves produce. This
fact can only assert itself if the contradictions
resolve themselves in a reasoned view in which there
are ethical ideas about the condition of things which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg058"></a>
it is sought to realize. These are the formative
principles for the new element which is to arise out
of the contradictories, and it is only in this reasoned
ethical view that the latter cease to be blind, leading
to no issue.</p>

<p>It was because we assumed the existence of
principles, of progress, in the facts, that we viewed
the advance of history, in which our future was
being prepared, as progress in civilization, even
though evolution condemned our optimism. And
even now, when facts of the most terrible character
cry out loudly against it, we shrink from giving
up our creed. It no longer, indeed, gives us
any real enlightenment, but the alternative,
which bases optimism on belief in the ethical
spirit, means such a revolution in our mode of
thought that we find it difficult to take it into
consideration.</p>

<p>With our reliance upon facts is bound up our
reliance on organizations. The activities and the
aims of our time are penetrated by a kind of obsession
that if we could only succeed in perfecting or
reforming in one direction or another the institutions
of our public and social life, the progress demanded
by civilization would begin of itself. We are,
indeed, far enough from unanimity as to the plan
needed for the reform of our arrangements: one
section sketches out an anti-democratic plan;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg059"></a>
others believe that our mistake lies in the fact that
democratic principles have not yet been applied
consistently; others, again, see salvation only in a
Socialist or Communist organization of society.
But all agree in attributing our present condition,
with its absence of true civilization, to a failure of
our institutions; all look for the attainment of such
civilization to a new organization of society; all
unite in thinking that with new institutions there
would arise a new spirit.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_11">
</div>

<p>In this terrible confusion are entangled not
only the unreflecting masses, but also many of
the most earnest amongst us. The materialism
of our age has reversed the relation between the
spiritual and the actual. It believes that something
with spiritual value can result from the
working of facts. It was even expected that the
war would bring us a spiritual regeneration! In
reality, however, the relation between them works in
the opposite direction. A spiritual element of real
value can, if it is present, influence the moulding of
reality so as to bring about desired results, and can
thus produce facts in support of itself. All institutions
and organizations have only a relative significance.
With the most diverse social and political
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg060"></a>
arrangements, the various civilized nations have all
sunk to the same depth of barbarism. What we
have experienced, and are still experiencing, must
surely convince us that the spirit is everything and
that institutions count for very little. Our institutions
are a failure because the spirit of barbarism
is at work in them. The best planned improvements
in the organization of our society (though we
are quite right in trying to secure them) cannot help
us at all until we become at the same time capable
of imparting a new spirit to our age.</p>

<p>The difficult problems with which we have to deal,
even those which lie entirely in the material and
economic sphere, are in the last resort only to be
solved by an inner change of character. The wisest
reforms in organization can only carry them a little
nearer solution, never to the goal. The only
conceivable way of bringing about a reconstruction
of our world on new lines is first of all to become new
men ourselves under the old circumstances, and then
as a society in a new frame of mind so to smooth out
the opposition between nations that a condition of
true civilization may again become possible. Everything
else is more or less wasted labour, because we
are thereby building not on the spirit, but on what
is merely external.</p>

<p>In the sphere of human events which decide the
future of mankind reality consists in an inner
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg061"></a>
conviction, not in given outward facts. Firm
ground for our feet we find in reasoned ethical
ideals. Are we going to draw from the spirit
strength to create new conditions and turn our
faces again to civilization, or are we going to continue
to draw our spirit from our surroundings and
go down with it to ruin? That is the fateful question
with which we are confronted.</p>

<p>The true sense for reality is that insight which tells
us that only through ethical ideas about things can
we arrive at a normal relation to reality. Only so
can man and society win all the power over events
that they are able to use. Without that power we
are, whatever we may choose to do, delivered over
into bondage to them.</p>

<p>What is going on to-day between nations and
within them throws a glaring illumination upon this
truth. The history of our time is characterized by
a lack of reason which has no parallel in the past.
Future historians will one day analyse this history
in detail, and test by means of it their learning
and their freedom from prejudice. But for all
future times there will be, as there is for to-day,
only one explanation, viz., that we sought to live
and to carry on with a civilization which had no
ethical principle behind it.</p>

<p class="chapter"></p>
<h2 id="mbp_toc_4">CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h4>THE WAY TO THE RESTORATION OF CIVILIZATION</h4>

<p class="summary">Civilization-ideals have become powerless. Evolution and decay in
the history of civilization. The reform of institutions and the reform
of convictions. The individual as the sole agent of the restoration of
civilization. The difficulties which beset the restoration of civilization.</p>

<p class="drop">The ethical conception of civilization, then, is
the only one that can be justified.</p>

<p>But where is the road that can bring us back from
barbarism to civilization? Is there such a road at
all?</p>

<p>The unethical conception of civilization answers:
“No.” To it all symptoms of decay are symptoms
of old age, and civilization, just like any other natural
process of growth, must after a certain period of
time reach its final end. There is nothing, therefore,
for us to do, so it says, but to take the causes of this
as quite natural, and do our best at any rate to find
interesting the unedifying phenomena of its senility,
which testify to the gradual loss of the ethical
character of civilization.</p>

<p>In the thinking then which surrenders itself to
our sense of reality, optimism and pessimism are
inextricably intermingled. If our optimism about
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg063"></a>
reality is proved untenable, the optimism which
thinks that continuous progress evolves itself among
the facts as such, then the spirit which from above
contemplates and analyses the situation turns without
much concern to the mild pessimistic supposition
that civilization has reached its Indian summer.</p>

<p>The ethical spirit cannot join in this little game of
“Optimism or pessimism?” It sees the symptoms
of decay as what they really are, viz., something
terrible. It asks itself with a shudder what will
become of the world if this dying process really goes
on unchecked. The condition of civilization is a
source of pain to it, for civilization is not an
object which it is interesting to analyse, but the
hope on which its thoughts fly out over the future
existence of the race. Belief in the possibility of a
renewal of civilization is an actual part of its life;
that is why it can no longer quiet itself with what
contents the sense of reality as it hovers between
optimism and pessimism.</p>

<p>Those who regard the decay of civilization as
something quite normal and natural console themselves
with the thought that it is not civilization,
but a civilization, which is falling a prey to dissolution;
that there will be a new age and a new race in
which there will blossom a new civilization. But
that is a mistake. The earth no longer has in
reserve, as it had once, gifted peoples as yet unused,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg064"></a>
who can relieve us and take our place in some
distant future as leaders of the spiritual life. We
already know all those which the earth has to dispose
of. There is not one among them which is not
already taking such a part in our civilization that
its spiritual fate is determined by our own. All of
them, the gifted and the ungifted, the distant and
the near, have felt the influence of those forces of
barbarism which are at work among us. All of
them are, like ourselves, diseased, and only as we
recover can they recover.</p>

<p>It is not the civilization of a race, but that of
mankind, present and future alike, that we must
give up as lost, if belief in a rebirth of our civilization
is a vain thing.</p>

<p>But it need not be so given up. If the ethical is
the essential element in civilization, decadence
changes into renaissance as soon as ethical activities
are set to work again in our convictions and in the
ideas which we undertake to stamp upon reality.
The attempt to bring this about is well worth
making, and it should be world-wide.</p>

<p>It is true that the difficulties that have to be
reckoned with in this undertaking are so great that
only the strongest faith in the power of the ethical
spirit will let us venture on it.</p>

<p>First among them towers up the inability of our
generation to understand what is and must be.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg065"></a>
The men of the Renaissance and the Illuminati of
the eighteenth century drew courage to desire the
renewal of the world through ideas from their conviction
of the absolute indefensibility of the material
and spiritual conditions under which they lived.
Unless with us, too, the many come to some such
conviction, we must continue incapable of taking in
hand this work, in which we must imitate them.
But the many obstinately refuse to see things as they
are, and hold with all their might to the most
optimistic view of them that is possible. For this
power, however, of idealizing with continually
lowering ideals the reality which is felt to be ever
less and less satisfying, pessimism also is partly
responsible. Our generation, though so proud of
its many achievements, no longer believes in the
one thing which is all-essential: the spiritual
advance of mankind. Having given up the expectation
of this, it can put up with the present age
without feeling such suffering as would compel it,
for very pain, to long for a new one. What a task
it will be to break the fetters of unthinking optimism
and unthinking pessimism which hold us prisoners,
and so to do what will pave the way for the renewal
of civilization!</p>

<p>A second difficulty besetting the work which lies
before us is that it is a piece of reconstruction. The
ideas of civilization which our age needs are not new
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg066"></a>
and strange to it. They have been in the possession
of mankind already, and are to be found in many an
antiquated formula. We have fundamentally nothing
else to do than to restore to them the respect
in which they were once held, and again regard them
seriously as we bring them into relation with the
reality which lies before us for treatment.</p>

<p>To make what is used up usable—is there a
harder task? “It is an impossible one,” says
history. “Never hitherto have worn-out ideas risen
to new power among the peoples who have worn
them out. Their disappearance has always been
a final one.”</p>

<p>That is true. In the history of civilization we
find nothing but discouragement for our task. Anyone
who finds history speaking optimistically lends
her a language which is not her own.</p>

<p>Yet from the history of the past we can infer only
what has been, not what will be. Even if it proves
that no single people has ever lived through the
decay of its civilization and a rebirth of it, we know
at once that this, which has never happened yet,
must happen with us, and therefore we cannot be
content to say that the reasoned ethical ideas on
which civilization rests get worn out in the course
of history, and console ourselves with the reflection
that this is exactly in accordance with the ordinary
processes of nature. We require to know why it has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg067"></a>
so happened hitherto, and to draw an explanation,
not from the analogy of nature, but from the laws of
spiritual life. We want to get into our hands the
key of the secret, so that we may with it unlock the
new age, the age in which the worn out becomes
again unworn and the spiritual and ethical can no
longer get worn out. We must study the history
of civilization otherwise than as our predecessors
did, or we shall be finally lost.</p>

<p>Why do not thoughts which contribute to
civilization retain the convincing power which they
once had, and which they deserve on account of
their content? Why do they lose the evidential
force of their moral and rational character? Why
do traditional truths cease to be realities and pass
from mouth to mouth as mere phrases?</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">

</div>

<p>Is this an unavoidable fate, or is the well drying
up because our thinking did not go down to the
permanent level of the water?</p>

<p>Moreover, it is not merely that the past survives
among us as something valueless; it may cast a
poisonous shade over us. There are thoughts on
which we have never let our minds work directly
because we found them ready formulated in history.
Ideas which we have inherited do not let the truth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg068"></a>
which is in them come out into active service, but
show it through a kind of dead mask. The worn
out achievements which pass over from a decadent
civilization into the current of a new age often
become like rejected products of metabolism, and
act as poisons.</p>

<p>Granted that the Teutonic nations received a
powerful stimulus to civilization at the Renaissance
by reverting to the ideas of Greco-Roman thinkers,
not less true is it that for many centuries they had
been kept by that same Greco-Roman civilization in
a condition of spiritual dependence which was wholly
in contradiction to their native character. They
took over from it decadent ideas which were for a
long time a hindrance to their normal spiritual life,
and thence came that strange mixture of strength
and weakness which is the chief characteristic of the
Middle Ages. The dangerous elements in the
Greco-Roman civilization of the past still show
themselves in our spiritual life. It is because
Oriental and Greek conceptions which have had
their day are still current among us that we bleed
to death over problems which otherwise would have
no existence for us. How much we suffer from the
one fact that to-day and for several centuries past
our thoughts about religion have been under the
hereditary foreign domination of Jewish transcendentalism
and Greek metaphysics, and, instead of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg069"></a>
being able to express themselves naturally, have
suffered continual distortion!</p>

<p>Because ideas get worn out in this way, and in
this condition hinder the thinking of later generations,
there is no continuity in the spiritual progress
of mankind, but only a confused succession of ups
and downs. The threads get broken, or knotted,
or lost, or when tied up again get tied wrongly.
Hitherto it has been thought possible to interpret
this up-and-down movement optimistically because
it was universally held that the Renaissance and
the age of the Illuminati were quite natural
successors of the Greco-Roman civilization, and it
was assumed further that, as a permanent result of
this, renewed civilizations would spring up in the
place of exhausted ones, and thus continual progress
be assured. But this generalization cannot justifiably
be drawn from such observations. It was
because new peoples came on the scene, who had
been only superficially touched by the decadent
civilizations and now produced others of their
own, that it was possible to see this succession of
ups and downs ending in an ascent. As a matter
of fact, however, our newer civilization was not
in any organic connection with the Greco-Roman,
even if it did take its first steps with the help of the
crutches which the latter provided; it may be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg070"></a>
described more truly as the reaction of a healthy
spirit against the worn out ideas which were thus
offered to it. The essential element in the process
was the contact of what was worn out with the fresh
thought of young peoples.</p>

<p>To-day, however, all our thought is losing its
power in its contact with the worn-out ideas of our
expiring civilization, or—in the case of the Hindus
and the Chinese—of our own and other expiring
civilizations. The up-and-down movement will end,
therefore, not in slow progress, but in unbroken
descent—unless we can succeed in giving the worn
out ideas a renewal of their youth.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_13">
</div>

<p>Another great difficulty in the way of the regeneration
of our civilization lies in the fact that it
must be an internal process, and not an external
as well, and that, therefore, there is no place for
healthy co-operation between the material and the
spiritual. From the Renaissance to the middle
of the nineteenth century the men who carried
on the work of civilization could expect help
towards spiritual progress from achievements in the
sphere of external organization. Demands in each
of these spheres stood side by side in their
programme and were pushed on simultaneously.
They were convinced that while working to transform
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg071"></a>
the institutions of public life they were
producing results which would call forth the
development of the new spiritual life. Success in
one sphere strengthened at once the hopes and the
energies that were at work in the other. They
laboured for the progressive democratization of the
State with the idea of thereby spreading through the
world the rule of grace and justice.</p>

<p>We, who have lived to see the spiritual bankruptcy
of all the institutions which they created, can
no longer work in this way simultaneously at the
reform of institutions and the revival of the spiritual
element. The help which such co-operation would
give is denied us. We cannot even reckon any
longer on the old co-operation between knowledge
and thought. Once these two were allies. The
latter fought for freedom and in so doing made a
road for the former, and, on the other hand, all
the results attained by knowledge worked for the
general good of the spiritual life in that the reign
of law in nature was more and more clearly
demonstrated, and the reign of prejudice was
becoming continually more restricted. The alliance
also strengthened the thought that the well-being of
mankind must be based upon spiritual laws. Thus
knowledge and thought joined in establishing the
authority of reason and the rational tone of mind.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg072"></a></p>

<p>To-day thought gets no help from science, and the
latter stands facing it independent and unconcerned.
The newest scientific knowledge may be allied with
an entirely unreflecting view of the universe. It
maintains that it is concerned only with the establishment
of individual facts, since it is only by means
of these that scientific knowledge can maintain its
practical character; the co-ordination of the
different branches of knowledge and the utilization
of the results to form a theory of the universe are,
it says, not its business. Once every man of science
was also a thinker who counted for something in the
general spiritual life of his generation. Our age has
discovered how to divorce knowledge from thought,
with the result that we have, indeed, a science which
is free, but hardly any science left which reflects.</p>

<p>Thus we no longer have available for the renewal
of our spiritual life any of the natural external helps
which we used to have. We are called upon for a
single kind of effort only, and have to work like men
who are rebuilding the damaged foundations of a
cathedral under the weight of the massive building.
There is no progress in the world of phenomena to
encourage us to persevere; an immense revolution
has to be brought about without the aid of any
collateral revolutionary activities.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_14">
</div>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg073"></a></p>

<p>Again, the renewal of civilization is hindered by
the fact that it is so exclusively the individual
personality which must be looked to as the agent
in the new movement.</p>

<p>The renewal of civilization has nothing to do with
movements which bear the character of experiences
of the crowd; there are never anything but reactions
to external happenings. But civilization can
only revive when there shall come into being in a
number of individuals a new tone of mind independent
of the one prevalent among the crowd and
in opposition to it, a tone of mind which will
gradually win influence over the collective one,
and in the end determine its character. It is only
an ethical movement which can rescue us from
the slough of barbarism, and the ethical comes into
existence only in individuals.</p>

<p>The final decision as to what the future of a
society shall be depends not on how near its
organization is to perfection, but on the degrees of
worthiness in its individual members. The most
important, and yet the least easily determinable,
element in history is the series of unobtrusive general
changes which take place in the individual dispositions
of the many. These are what precede and
cause the happenings, and this is why it is so
difficult to understand thoroughly the men and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg074"></a>
events of past times. The character and worth of
individuals among the mass and the way they
work themselves into membership of the whole
body, receiving influences from it and giving others
back, we can even to-day only partially and
uncertainly understand.</p>

<p>One thing, however, is clear. Where the collective
body works more strongly on the individual
than the latter does upon it, the result is deterioration,
because the noble element on which everything
depends, viz., the spiritual and moral worthiness of
the individual, is thereby necessarily constricted
and hampered. Decay of the spiritual and moral
life then sets in, which renders society incapable of
understanding and solving the problems which it has
to face. Thereupon, sooner or later, it is involved
in catastrophe.</p>

<p>That is the condition in which we are now, and
that is why it is the duty of individuals to rise to a
higher conception of their capabilities and undertake
again the function which only the individual can
perform, that of producing new spiritual-ethical
ideas. If this does not come about in a multitude
of cases nothing can save us.</p>

<p>A new public opinion must be created privately
and unobtrusively. The existing one is maintained
by the Press, by propaganda, by organization, and
by financial and other influences which are at its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg075"></a>
disposal. This unnatural way of spreading ideas
must be opposed by the natural one, which goes
from man to man and relies solely on the truth of
the thoughts and the hearer’s receptiveness for
new truth. Unarmed, and following the human
spirit’s primitive and natural fighting method,
it must attack the other, which faces it, as
Goliath faced David, in the mighty armour of
the age.</p>

<p>About the struggle which must needs ensue no
historical analogy can tell us much. The past has,
no doubt, seen the struggle of the free-thinking
individual against the fettered spirit of a whole
society, but the problem has never presented itself
on the scale on which it does to-day, because the
fettering of the collective spirit as it is fettered
to-day by modern organizations, modern unreflectiveness,
and modern popular passions, is a
phenomenon without precedent in history.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_15">
</div>

<p>Will the man of to-day have strength to carry
out what the spirit demands from him, and what the
age would like to make impossible?</p>

<p>In the over-organized societies which in a hundred
ways have him in their power, is he destined to
become once more an independent personality and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg076"></a>
to exert influence back upon them? They will
use every means to keep him in that condition
of impersonality which suits them. They fear
personality because the spirit and the truth, which
they would like to muzzle, find in it a means of
expressing themselves. And their power is, unfortunately,
as great as their fear.</p>

<p>There is a tragic alliance between society as a
whole and its economic conditions. With a grim
relentlessness those conditions tend to bring up the
man of to-day as a being without freedom, without
self-collectedness, without independence, in short
as a human being so full of deficiencies that he lacks
the qualities of humanity. And they are the last
things that we can change. Even if it should be
granted us that the spirit should begin its work, we
shall only slowly and incompletely gain power over
these forces. There is, in fact, being demanded from
the will that which our conditions of life refuse to
allow.</p>

<p>And how heavy the tasks that the spirit has to
take in hand! It has to create the power of understanding
the truth that is really true where at
present nothing is current but propagandist truth.
It has to depose ignoble patriotism, and enthrone
the noble kind of patriotism which aims at ends
that are worthy of the whole of mankind, in circles
where the hopeless issues of past and present
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg077"></a>
political activities keep nationalist passions aglow
even among those who in their hearts would fain be
free from them. It has to get the fact that civilization
is an interest of all men and of humanity as a
whole recognized again in places where national
civilization is to-day worshipped as an idol, and
the notion of a humanity with a common civilization
lies broken to fragments. It has to maintain
our faith in the civilized State, even though our
modern States, spiritually and economically ruined
by the war, have no time to think about the
tasks of civilization, and dare not devote their
attention to anything but how to use every
possible means, even those which undermine the
conception of justice, to collect money with which
to prolong their own existence. It has to unite
us by giving us a single ideal of civilized man,
and this in a world where one nation has robbed
its neighbour of all faith in humanity, idealism,
righteousness, reasonableness, and truthfulness, and
all alike have come under the domination of powers
which are plunging us ever deeper into barbarism.
It has to get attention concentrated on civilization
while the growing difficulty of making a living
absorbs the masses more and more in material cares,
and makes all other things seem to them to be mere
shadows. It has to give us faith in the possibility of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg078"></a>
progress while the reaction of the economic on the
spiritual becomes more pernicious every day and
contributes to an ever growing demoralization. It
has to provide us with a capacity for hope at a time
when not only secular and religious institutions and
associations, but the men, too, who are looked upon
as leaders, continually fail us, when artists and men
of learning show themselves as supporters of
barbarism, and notabilities who pass for thinkers,
and behave outwardly as such, are revealed, when
crises come, as being nothing more than writers and
members of academies.</p>

<p>All these hindrances stand in the path of the will
to civilization. A dull despair hovers about us.
How well we now understand the men of the
Greco-Roman decadence, who stood before events
incapable of resistance, and, leaving the world to its
fate, withdrew upon their inner selves! Like them,
we are bewildered by our experience of life. Like
them, we hear enticing voices which say to us that
the one thing which can still make life tolerable is to
live for the day. We must, we are told, renounce
every wish to think or hope about anything beyond
our own fate. We must find rest in resignation.</p>

<p>The recognition that civilization is founded on
some sort of theory of the universe, and can be
restored only through a spiritual awakening and a
will for ethical good in the mass of mankind, compels
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg079"></a>
us to make clear to ourselves those difficulties in the
way of a rebirth of civilization which ordinary
reflection would overlook. But at the same time
it raises us above all considerations of possibility or
impossibility. If the ethical spirit provides a
sufficient standing ground in the sphere of events
for making civilization a reality, then we shall get
civilization, provided that we return to a suitable
theory of the universe and the convictions to which
this properly gives birth.</p>

<p>The history of our decadence preaches the truth
that when hope is dead the spirit becomes the
deciding court of appeal, and this truth will in
the future find in us a sublime and noble fulfilment.</p>

<h2 id="mbp_toc_5">CHAPTER V</h2>
<h4>CIVILIZATION AND THEORIES OF THE UNIVERSE</h4>

<p class="summary">The regeneration of our theory of the universe and the restoration of
civilization. A reflective theory of the universe; rationalism and
mysticism. The optimistic-ethical theory as a theory of civilization.
The regeneration of our ideas by reflection about the meaning of life.</p>

<p class="drop">The greatest of all the spirit’s tasks is to produce
a theory of the universe (<i>Weltanschauung</i><a href="#in2" id="in2-ref" class="pginternal">*</a>), for in
such a theory all the ideas, convictions and activities
of an age have their roots, and it is only when we
have arrived at one which is compatible with civilization
that we are capable of holding the ideas and
convictions which are the conditions of civilization
in general.</p>

<p>What is meant by a theory of the universe? It
is the content of the thoughts of society and the
individuals which compose it about the nature and
object of the world in which they live, and the
position and the destiny of mankind and of individual
men within it. What significance have the
society in which I live and I myself in the world?
What do we want to do in the world, what do we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg081"></a>
hope to get from it, and what is our duty to it?
The answer given by the majority to these fundamental
questions about existence decides what the
spirit is in which they and their age live.</p>

<p>Is not this putting too high the value of a theory
of the universe?</p>

<p>At present, certainly, the majority do not, as a
rule, attain to any properly thought-out theory, nor
do they feel the need of deriving their ideas and
convictions from such a source. They are in tune,
more or less, with all the tones which pervade the
age in which they live.</p>

<p>But who are the musicians who have produced
these tones? They are the personalities who have
thought out theories of the universe, and drawn
from them the ideas, more or less valuable, which
are current amongst us to-day. In this way all
thoughts, whether those of individuals or those of
society, go back ultimately, in some way or other,
to a theory of the universe. Every age lives in the
consciousness of what has been provided for it by
the thinkers under whose influence it stands.</p>

<p>Plato was wrong in holding that the philosophers
of a State should also be its governors. Their
supremacy is a different and a higher one than that
which consists in taking cognizance of laws and
ordinances and giving effect to official authority.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg082"></a>
They are the officers of the general staff who sit in
the background thinking out, with more or less
clearness of vision, the details of the battle which is
to be fought. Those who play their part in the
public eye are the subordinate officers who, for their
variously sized units, convert the general directions
of the staff into orders of the day: namely, that the
forces will start at such and such a time, move in
this or that direction, and occupy this or that point.
Kant and Hegel have commanded millions who had
never read a line of their writings, and who did not
even know that they were obeying their orders.</p>

<p>Those who command, whether it be in a large or
a small sphere, can only carry out what is already
in the thought of the age. They do not build the
instrument on which they have to play, but are
merely given a seat at it. Nor do they compose the
piece they have to play; it is simply put before
them, and they cannot alter it; they can only
reproduce it with more or less skill and success.
If it is meaningless, they cannot do much to improve
it, but neither, if it is good, can they damage it
seriously.</p>

<p>To the question, then, whether it is personalities
or ideas which decide the fate of an age, the answer
is that the age gets its ideas from personalities. If
the thinkers of a certain period produce a worthy
theory of the universe, then ideas pass into currency
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg083"></a>
which guarantee progress; if they are not
capable of such production, then decadence sets in
in some form or other. Every theory of the universe
draws after it its own special results in history.</p>

<p>The fall of the Roman Empire in spite of that
empire’s having over it so many rulers of conspicuous
ability, may be traced ultimately to the
fact that ancient philosophy produced no theory of
the universe with ideas which tended to that
empire’s preservation. With the rise of Stoicism,
as the definitive answer of the philosophic thought
of antiquity, the fate of the world down to the
Middle Ages was decided. The idea of resignation,
noble idea as it is, could not ensure progress in a
world-wide empire. The efforts of its strongest
emperors were useless. The yarn with which they
had to weave was rotten.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, under the rule, in most
places, of insignificant rococo-sovereigns and
rococo-ministers, a progressive movement began among
the nations of Europe which was unique in the
history of the world. Why? The thinkers of the
Illuminati and of rationalism produced a worthy
theory of the universe from which worthy ideas
were spread among mankind.</p>

<p>But when history began to shape itself in accordance
with these ideas, the thought which had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg084"></a>
produced the progress came to a halt, and we have
now a generation which is squandering the precious
heritage it has received from the past, and is living
in a world of ruins, because it cannot complete the
building which that past began. Even had our
rulers and statesmen been less short-sighted than
they actually were, they would not in the long run
have been able to avert the catastrophe which
burst upon us. Both the inner and the outer
collapse of civilization were latent in the circumstances
produced by the prevalent view of the
universe. The rulers, small and great alike, did [nothing but]
act in accordance with the spirit of the age.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of the influence exerted
by the <i>Aufklärung</i>, rationalism, and the serious
philosophy of the early nineteenth century, the seeds
were sown of the world-war to come. Then began
to disappear also the ideas and convictions which
would have made possible a solution on right lines
of the controversies which arise between nations.</p>

<p>Thus the course of events brought us into a
position in which we had to get along without any
real theory of the universe. The collapse of
philosophy and the rise and influence of scientific
modes of thought made it impossible to arrive at
an idealist theory which should satisfy thought.
Moreover, our age is poorer in deep thinkers than
perhaps any preceding one. There were a few
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg085"></a>
strong spirits who, with varied knowledge, and with
devoted efforts, offered the world some patchwork
thought; there were some dazzling comets; but
that was all that was granted us. Their products
in the way of world theories were good enough to
interest a circle of academic culture, or to delight a
few believing followers, but the people as a whole
were entirely untouched.</p>

<p>We began, therefore, to persuade ourselves that
it was, after all, possible to get through without any
theory of the universe. The feeling that we needed
to stir ourselves up to ask questions about the world
and life, and to come to a decision upon them,
gradually died away. In the unreflective condition
to which we had surrendered ourselves, we took, to
meet the claims of our own life and the nation’s life,
the chance ideas provided by our feeling for reality.
During more than a generation and a half we
had proof enough and to spare that the theory
which is the result of absence of theory is the most
worthless of all, involving not only ruin to the
spiritual life, but ruin universal. For where there
is no general staff to think out its plan of campaign
for any generation its subordinate officers lead it,
as in actual warfare so in the sphere of ideas, from
one profitless adventure to another.</p>

<p>The reconstruction of our age, then, can begin
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg086"></a>
only with a reconstruction of a theory of the
universe. There is hardly anything more urgent
in its claim on us than this which seems to be so far
off and abstract. Only when we have made ourselves
at home again in the solid thought-building
of a theory which can support a civilization, and
when we take from it, all of us in co-operation, ideas
which can stimulate our life and work, only then
can there again arise a society which shall possess
ideals with magnificent aims and be able to bring
these into effective agreement with reality. It is
from new ideas that we must build history anew.</p>

<p>For individuals as for the community, life without
a theory of things is a pathological disturbance of
the higher capacity for self-direction.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_16">
</div>

<p>What conditions must a theory of the universe
fulfil to enable it to create a civilization?</p>

<p>First, and defined generally, it must be the
product of thought. Nothing but what is born of
thought and addresses itself to thought can be a
spiritual power affecting the whole of mankind.
Only what has been well turned over in the thought
of the many, and thus recognized as truth, possesses
a natural power of conviction which will work on
other minds and will continue to be effective.
Only where there is a constant appeal to the need
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg087"></a>
of a reflective view of things are all man’s spiritual
capacities called into activity.</p>

<p>Our age has a kind of artistic prejudice against a
reflective theory of the universe. We are still
children of the Romantic movement to a greater
extent than we realize. What that movement
produced in opposition to the <i>Aufklärung</i> and to
rationalism seems to us valid for all ages against
any theory that would found itself solely on thought.
In such a theory of the universe we can see beforehand
the world dominated by a barren intellectualism,
convictions governed by mere utility, and
a shallow optimism, which together throw a wet
blanket over all human genius and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In a great deal of the opposition which it offered
to rationalism the reaction of the early nineteenth
century was right. Nevertheless it remains true
that it despised and distorted what was, in spite of
all its imperfections, the greatest and most valuable
manifestation of the spiritual life of man that the
world has yet seen. Down through all circles of
cultured and uncultured alike there prevailed at
that time a belief in thought and a reverence for
truth. For that reason alone that age stands
higher than any which preceded it, and much
higher than our own.</p>

<p>At no price must the feelings and phrases of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg088"></a>
Romanticism be allowed to prevent our generation
from forming a clear conception of what reason
really is. It is no dry intellectualism which would
suppress all the manifold movements of our inner
life, but the totality of all the functions of our spirit
in their living action and interaction. In it our
intellect and our will hold that mysterious intercourse
which determines the character of our
spiritual being. These fundamental ideas which it
produces contain all that we can feel or imagine
about our destiny and that of mankind, and give our
whole being its direction and its value. The
enthusiasm which comes from thought has the same
relation to that which rises from the cauldron of
feeling as the wind which sweeps the heights has to
that which eddies about between the hills. If we
venture once more to seek help from the light of
reason, we shall no longer keep ourselves down at
the level of a generation which has ceased to be
capable of enthusiasm, but shall follow the deep and
noble passion inspired by great and sublime ideals.
This will so fill and expand our being that that by
which we now live will seem to be merely a petty
kind of excitement, and will disappear.</p>

<p>Rationalism is more than a movement of thought
which realized itself at the end of the eighteenth and
the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. It is a
necessary phenomenon in all normal spiritual life.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg089"></a>
All real progress in the world is in the last analysis
produced by rationalism.</p>

<p>It is true that the intellectual productions of the
period which we designate historically as the
rationalistic are incomplete and unsatisfactory, but
the principle, which was then established, of basing
our views of the universe on thought and thought
alone, is valid for all time. Even if the tree’s earliest
fruit did not ripen perfectly, the tree itself remains,
nevertheless, the tree of life for the life of our spirit.</p>

<p>All the movements that have claimed to take the
place of rationalism stand far below it in the matter
of achievement. From speculative thought, from
history, from feeling, from æsthetics, from science,
they tried to construct a theory of the universe,
grubbing at haphazard in the world around them
instead of excavating scientifically. Rationalism
alone chose the right place for its digging, and dug
systematically, according to plan. If it found only
metal of small value, that was because, with the
means at its disposal, it could not go deep enough.
Impoverished and ruined as we are because we
sought as mere adventurers, we must make up our
minds to sink another shaft in the ground where
rationalism worked, and to go down through all
the strata to see whether we cannot find the gold
which must certainly be there.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg090"></a></p>

<p>To think out to the end a theory of the universe
which has been produced by thought—that is the
only possible way of finding our bearings amid the
confusion of the world of thought to-day.</p>

<p>Philosophical, historical, and scientific questions
with which it was not capable of dealing overwhelmed
the earlier rationalism like an avalanche,
and buried it in the middle of its journey. The new
rational theory of the universe must work its way
out of this chaos. Leaving itself freely open to the
whole influence of the world of fact, it must explore
every path offered by reflection and knowledge in its
effort to reach the ultimate meaning of being and
life, and to see whether it can solve some of the
riddles which they present.</p>

<p>The ultimate knowledge, in which man recognizes
his own being as a part of the All, belongs, they say,
to the realm of mysticism, by which is meant that
he does not reach it by the method of ordinary
reflection, but somehow or other lives himself
into it.</p>

<p>But why assume that the road of thought must
suddenly stop at the frontier of mysticism? It is
true that pure reason has hitherto called a halt
whenever it came into this neighbourhood, for it
was unwilling to go beyond the point at which it
could still exhibit everything as part of a smooth,
logical plan. Mysticism, on its side, always depreciated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg091"></a>
pure reason as much as it could, to prevent
at all costs the idea from gaining currency that it
was in any way bound to give an account to reason.
And yet, although they refuse to recognize each
other, the two belong to each other.</p>

<p>It is in reason that intellect and will, which in our
nature are mysteriously bound up together, seek
to come to a mutual understanding. The ultimate
knowledge that we strive to acquire is knowledge of
life, which intellect looks at from without, will from
within. Since life is the ultimate object of knowledge,
our ultimate knowledge is necessarily our
thinking experience of life, but this does not lie
outside the sphere of reason, but within reason itself.
Only when the will has thought out its relation to
the intellect, has come, as far as it can, into line
with it, has penetrated it, and in it become logical,
is it in a position to comprehend itself, so far as its
nature allows this, as a part of the universal will-to-live
and a part of being in general. If it merely
leaves the intellect on one side, it loses itself in
confused imaginings, while the intellect, which, like
the rationalism of the past, will not allow that in
order to understand life it must finally lose itself in
thinking experience, renounces all hope of constructing
a deep and firmly based theory of the
universe.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg092"></a></p>

<p>Thus reflection, when pursued to the end, lead
somewhere and somehow to a living mysticism
which is for all men everywhere a necessary element
of thought.</p>

<p>Doubts whether the mass of men can ever attain
to that level of reflection about themselves and the
world which is demanded by a reflective theory of
the universe, are quite justifiable if the man of to-day
is taken as an example of the race. But he, with
his diminished need of thought, is a pathological
phenomenon.</p>

<p>In reality there is given in the mental endowment
of the average man a capacity for thought which to
the individual makes the creation of a reflective
theory of things of his own not only possible, but
under normal conditions even a necessity. The
great movements of illumination in ancient and
modern times help to maintain the confident belief
that there is in the mass of mankind a power of
thought on fundamentals which can be roused to
activity. This belief is strengthened by observation
of mankind and intercourse with the young.
A fundamental impulse to reflect about the universe
stirs us during those years in which we begin to think
independently. Later on we let it languish, even
though feeling clearly that we thereby impoverish
ourselves and become less capable of what is good.
We are like springs of water which no longer run
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg093"></a>
because they have not been watched and have
gradually become choked with rubbish.</p>

<p>More than any other age has our own neglected
to watch the thousand springs of thought; hence
the drought in which we are pining. But if we only
go on to remove the rubbish which conceals the
water, the sands will be irrigated again, and life will
spring up where hitherto there has been only a
desert.</p>

<p>Certainly there are guides and the guided in the
department of world-theories, as in others. So far
the independence of the mass of men remains a
relative one. The question is only whether the
influence of the guides leads to dependence or
independence. The latter brings with it a development
in the direction of truthfulness; the former
means the death of that virtue.</p>

<p>Every being who calls himself a man is meant
to develop into a real personality within a reflective
theory of the universe which he has created for
himself.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_17">
</div>

<p>But of what character must the theory be if ideas
and convictions about civilization are to be based
on it?</p>

<p>That theory of the universe is optimistic which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg094"></a>
gives existence the preference as against
non-existence and thus affirms life as something possessing
value in itself. From this attitude to the
universe and to life results the impulse to raise
existence, in so far as our influence can affect it,
to its highest level of value. Thence originates
activity directed to the improvement of the living
conditions of individuals, of society, of nations and of
humanity, from which spring the external achievements
of civilization, the lordship of spirit over
the powers of nature, and the higher social
organization.</p>

<p>Ethics is the activity of man directed to secure the
inner perfection of his own personality. In itself
it is quite independent of whether the theory of the
universe is pessimistic or optimistic. But its sphere
of action is contracted or widened according as it
appears in connection with a theory of the first or
the second type.</p>

<p>In the determinist-pessimistic theory of the
universe, as we have it in the thought of the Brāhmans
or of Schopenhauer, ethics has nothing
whatever to do with the objective world. It aims
solely at securing the self-perfection of the individual
as this comes to pass in inner freedom and disconnection
from the world and the spirit of the
world.</p>

<p>But the scope of ethics is extended in proportion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg095"></a>
as it develops and strengthens a connection with a
theory of the universe which is affirmative toward
the world and life. Its aim is now the inner perfection
of the individual and at the same time the
direction of his activity so as to take effect on other
men and on the objective world. It is true that in
face of the objective world and its spirit ethics
no longer holds itself up to man as an aim in itself.
By its means man is to become capable of acting
among men and in the world as a higher and purer
force, and thus to do his part towards the actualization
of the ideal of general progress.</p>

<p>Thus the optimistic-ethical theory of the universe
works in partnership with ethics to produce civilization.
Neither is capable of doing so by itself.
Optimism supplies confidence that the world-process
has somehow or other a spiritual-sensible aim, and
that the improvement of the general relations of the
world and of society promotes the spiritual-moral
perfection of the individual. From ethics is derived
ability to develop the purposive state of mind
necessary to produce action on the world and society
and to cause the co-operation of all our achievements
to secure the spiritual and moral perfection of the
individual which is the final end of civilization.</p>

<p>Once we have recognized that the energies which
spring out of a theory of the universe, and impel us to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg096"></a>
create a civilization, are rooted in the ethical and the
optimistic, we get light on the question why and how
our ideals of civilization got worn out. This question
is not to be answered by good or bad analogies from
nature. The decisive answer is that they got worn
out because we had not succeeded in establishing the
ethical and optimistic elements on a sufficiently firm
foundation.</p>

<p>If we should analyse the process in which the
ideas and convictions that produce civilization
reveal themselves, it would be found that whenever
an advance has been registered, either the optimist
or the ethical element in the theory of the universe
has proved more attractive than usual, and has
had as its consequence a progressive development.
When civilization is decaying there is the same chain
of causation, but it works negatively. The building
is damaged or falls in because the optimist element
or the ethical, or both, give way like a weak foundation.
No amount of inquiry will give any other
reason for the changes. All imaginable ideas and
convictions of that character spring from optimism
and the ethical impulse. If these two pillars are
strong enough, we need have no fears about the
building.</p>

<p>The future of civilization depends, therefore, on
whether it is possible for thought to reach a theory
of the universe which will have a more secure and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg097"></a>
fundamental hold on optimism and the ethical
impulse than its predecessors have had.</p>

<div class="tei" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em">
<img alt="sigla" height="33" src="images/sigla.jpg" width="128" id="img_images_sigla.jpg_18">
</div>

<p>We Westerners dream of a theory of the
universe which corresponds to our impulse to
action and at the same time justifies it. We
have not been able to formulate such a theory
definitely. At present we are in the state of possessing
merely an impulse without any definite orientation.
The spirit of the age drives us into action
without allowing us to attain any clear view of the
objective world and of life. It claims our toil
inexorably in the service of this or that end, this or
that achievement. It keeps us in a sort of intoxication
of activity so that we may never have time
to reflect and to ask ourselves what this restless
sacrifice of ourselves to ends and achievements really
has to do with the meaning of the world and of our
lives. And so we wander hither and thither in the
gathering dusk formed by lack of any definite theory
of the universe like homeless, drunken mercenaries,
and enlist indifferently in the service of the common
and the great without distinguishing between them.
And the more hopeless becomes the condition of the
world in which this adventurous impulse to action
and progress ranges to and fro, the more bewildered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg098"></a>
becomes our whole conception of things and the more
purposeless and irrational the doings of those who
have enlisted under the banner of such an impulse.</p>

<p>How little reflection is present in the Western
impulse to action becomes evident when this tries to
square its ideas with those of the Far East. For
thought in the Far East has been constantly occupied
in its search for the meaning of life, and forces
us to consider the problem of the meaning of our
own restlessness, the problem which we Westerners
burke so persistently. We are utterly at a loss when
we contemplate the ideas which are presented to us
in Indian thought. We turn away from the
intellectual presumption which we find there. We
are conscious of the unsatisfying and incomplete
elements in the ideal of cessation from action. We
feel instinctively that the will-to-progress is justified
not only in its aspect as directed to the spiritual
perfection of personality, but also in that which looks
towards the general and material.</p>

<p>For ourselves we dare to allege that we adventurers,
who take up an affirmative attitude toward
the world and toward life, however great and even
ghastly our mistakes may be, can yet show not only
greater material, but also greater spiritual and
ethical, contributions than can those who lie under
the ban of a theory of the universe characterized by
cessation from action.</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg099"></a></p>

<p>And yet, all the same, we cannot feel ourselves
completely justified in the face of these strange
Eastern theories. They have in them something full
of nobility which retains its hold on us, even fascinates
us. This tinge of nobility comes from the fact
that these convictions are born of a search for a
theory of the universe and for the meaning of life.
With us, on the other hand, activist instincts and
impulses take the place of a theory of the universe.
We have no theory affirming the world and life to
oppose to the negative theory of these thinkers, no
thought which has found a basis for an optimistic
conception of existence to oppose to this other,
which has arrived at a pessimistic conception.</p>

<p>The reawakening of the Western spirit must thus
begin by our people, educated and simple alike,
becoming conscious of their lack of a theory of the
universe and feeling the horror of their consequent
position. We can no longer be satisfied to make
shift with substitutes for such a theory. What is
the basis of the will-to-activity and progress which
impels both to great actions and to terrible deeds,
and which tries to keep us from reflection? We
must bend all our energies to the solution of this
problem.</p>

<p>There is only one way in which we can hope to
emerge from the meaningless state in which we are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg100"></a>
now held captive into one informed with meaning.
Each one of us must turn to contemplate his own
being, and we must all give ourselves to co-operative
reflection so as to discover how our will to action and
to progress may be intellectually based on the way
in which we interpret our own lives and the life
around us, and the meaning which we give to these.</p>

<p>The great revision of the convictions and ideals
in which and for which we live will only take place
when, by constantly proclaiming them, we have
given currency among our contemporaries to ideas
and thoughts other and better than those by which
they are dominated at the moment. Only thus will
the many come to reflect about the meaning of life
and to reorientate, revise and make over again their
ideals of action and of progress, asking themselves
whether these have a meaning in accord with that
which we attribute to our life itself. This personal
reflection about final and elemental things is the one
and only reliable way of measuring values. My
willing and doing have real meaning and value only
in proportion as the aims which action sets before
itself can be justified as being in direct accord with
my interpretation of my own and of other life.
All else, however much it may pass current as
approved by tradition, usage, and public opinion,
is vain and dangerous.</p>

<p>It seems, indeed, a matter for scorn and derision
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg101"></a>
that we should urge men to anything so remote as
a return to reflection about the meaning of life at a
time when the sufferings and the follies of the
nations have become so intense and so extended,
when unemployment and poverty and starvation
are rife, when power is being dissipated on all sides
in the most shameless and senseless way, and when
organized human life is dislocated in every direction.
But only when the general population begins to
reflect in this way will forces come into being which
will be able to effect something to counterbalance
all this ruin and misery. Whatever other measures
it is attempted to carry out will have doubtful and
altogether inadequate results.</p>

<p>When in the spring the withered grey of the
pastures gives place to green, this is due to the
millions of young shoots which sprout up freshly
from the old roots. In like manner the revival of
thought which is essential for our time can only
come through a transformation of the opinions and
ideals of the many brought about by individual and
universal reflection about the meaning of life and of
the world.</p>

<p>But are we sure of being able to think out that
affirmation of the world and of life, which is such
a powerful impulse in us, into a theory of the world
and of life from which a stream of energy productive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg102"></a>
of intelligible life and action may convincingly and
constantly proceed? How are we to succeed in
doing what the spirit of the Western world during
past generations has in vain toiled to accomplish?</p>

<p>Even if thought, once more awakened, should only
attain to an incomplete and unsatisfying theory of
the universe, yet this, as the truth to which we have
ourselves worked through, would be of more value
than a complete lack of any theory at all, or, alternatively,
than any sort of authoritative theory to
which, neglecting the demands of true thought, we
cling on account of its supposed intrinsic value
without having any real and thorough belief in it.</p>

<p>The beginning of all spiritual life of any real value
is courageous faith in truth and open confession of
the same. The most profound religious experience,
too, is not alien to thought, but must be capable of
derivation from this if it is to be given a true and
deep basis. Mere reflection about the meaning of
life has already value in itself. If such reflection
should again come into being amongst us, the ideals,
born of vanity and of suffering, which now flourish
in rank profusion like evil weeds among the convictions
of the generality of people, would infallibly
wither away and die. How much would already be
accomplished towards our salvation from our present
circumstances if only we would all give up three
minutes every evening to gazing up into the infinite
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg103"></a>
world of the starry heavens and meditating on it,
or if in taking part in a funeral procession we would
reflect on the enigma of life and death, instead of
engaging in thoughtless conversation as we follow
behind the coffin! The ideals, born of folly and
suffering, of those who make public opinion and
direct public events, would have no more power over
men if they once began to reflect about eternity and
mortality, existence and dissolution, and thus learnt
to distinguish between true and false standards,
between those which possess real value and those
which do not. The old-time rabbis used to teach
that the kingdom of God would come if only the
whole of Israel would really keep a single Sabbath
simultaneously! How much more is it true that
the injustice and violence and untruth, which are
now bringing so much disaster on the human race,
would lose their power if only a single real trace of
reflection about the meaning of the world and of life
should appear amongst us!</p>

<p>But is there not a danger in challenging men with
this question about the meaning of life and in
demanding that our impulse to action should justify
and clarify itself in such reflection as that of which
we have spoken? Shall we not lose, in acceding to
this demand, some irreplaceable element of naïve
enthusiasm?</p>

<p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg104"></a></p>

<p>We need not thus be anxious as to how strong or
how weak our impulse to action will prove to be
when it shall have arrived, as the result of intellectual
reflection, at an interpretation of life. Only
that has real meaning for life which is given as an
element of our interpretation of life. It is not the
quantity, but the quality, of activity that really
matters. What is needed is that our will-to-action
should become conscious of itself and should cease
to work blindly.</p>

<p>But perhaps, it may be objected, we shall end
in the resignation of agnosticism, and shall be
obliged to confess that we cannot discover any
meaning in the universe or in life.</p>

<p>If thought is to set out on its journey unhampered,
it must be prepared for anything, even for arrival at
intellectual agnosticism. But even if our will-to-action
is destined to wrestle endlessly and unavailingly
with an agnostic view of the universe and of
life, still this painful disenchantment is better for it
than persistent refusal to think out its position at
all. For this disenchantment does, at any rate, mean
that we are clear as to what we are doing.</p>

<p>There is, however, no necessity whatever for such
an attitude of resignation. We feel that a position
of affirmation regarding the world and life is something
which is in itself both necessary and valuable.
Therefore it is at least likely that a foundation can be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a class="tei" id="Pg105"></a>
found for it in thought. Since it is an innate
element of our will-to-live, it must be possible to
comprehend it as a necessary corollary to our interpretation
of life. Perhaps we shall have to look
elsewhere than we have done hitherto for the real
basis of that theory of the universe which carries
with it affirmation of the world and of life. Previous
thought imagined that it could deduce the meaning
of life from its interpretation of the universe. It
may be that we shall be obliged to resign ourselves
to abandon the problem of the interpretation of the
universe and to find the meaning of our life in the
will-to-live as this exists in ourselves.</p>

<p>The ways along which we have to struggle toward
the goal may be veiled in darkness, yet the direction
in which we must travel is clear. We must reflect
together about the meaning of life; we must strive
together to attain to a theory of the universe
affirmative of the world and of life, in which the
impulse to action which we experience as a necessary
and valuable element of our being may find justification,
orientation, clarity and depth, may receive a
fresh access of moral strength, and be retempered,
and thus become capable of formulating, and of
acting on, definite ideals of civilization, inspired by
the spirit of true humanitarianism.</p>

<h2>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES</h2>

<p>The formatting of both the .htm and .txt files followed that of two
similar books, The Quest of the Historical Jesus and The Mystery of the Kingdom of
God, already in Project Gutenberg.</p>

<p>I made several hyphenation choices, mostly forced by de-hyphenation at the ends
of lines:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1. world-theory</li>
    <li>2. overcoming</li>
    <li>3. self-regarding</li>
    <li>4. never-concentrated</li>
    <li>5. over-organization</li>
    <li>6. over-valuation</li>
    <li>7. self-importance</li>
    <li>8. rococo-ministers</li>
    <li>9. non-existence</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, on page 5 of the .pdf file on Internet Archive, the display of
this page was corrupted in my copy. As pointed out by an editor, this has been
corrected in the current version at Internet Archive.</p>

<p>On page 84 the word "not" in the sentence:

"The rulers, small and great alike, did not act in accordance with the spirit of the age.""

was changed to "[nothing but]". The original German is:

"Die kleinen und die großen Regierenden taten nichts anderes, als daß sie im Geiste der Zeit handelten."

Google Translate (4/25/2025) renders this as:

"The small and the big rulers did nothing other than act in the spirit of the times."

The printed sentence in the book is either a typo or a mis-translation. It does not fit
the sense of the author who means that the rulers themselves are not to blame for the collapse
of civilization but rather it is the fault of the "spirit of the age".</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
